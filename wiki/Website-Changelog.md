## Tips for writing consistent changelog entries

### General guidance
- Changelog entries should always start with a paragraph (not a list).
- Consider using a list instead of a long paragraph of text to communicate multiple changes for one element.
- If there are changes to multiple components in the same entry, each change should be described in a new paragraph (and a list of details, if needed).
- If you need to include a note (like a migration tip), add it to the bottom of the entry in a new paragraph. If you need to draw more attention to the note, consider using emphasized text.
- Entries should use complete sentences but be short, clear, and descriptive enough to be helpful.
- Use past tense.
- Entries should always end with a period.

### Consistent terminology
- Use consistent terms for different types of changes: 
  - Bugfix: “Fixed”
  - New component, token, variant: “Added”
  - Update: “Changed”, “Refactored”
  - Removed or deleted: “Removed”
  - Other possible cases: “Upgraded”, “Reduced”, “Prevented”
 
### Component references
- When referencing components, use the plain-text component name, e.g., `Accordion`.
- All components or token names, including those in the summary, should be enclosed in backticks (`).

### Content formatting

While best practice guidelines are provided, clarity is most important, so use your best judgment. 

#### Component changes

For component changes, place the component name first and enclose it in backticks (`), followed by a dash (-), and then a brief summary.

| Do | Dont |
|:---|:-----|
| `Dropdown` - changed the `@height` property to use `max-height` instead of a fixed height.  | Changed the `@height` property in `Dropdown` to use `max-height` instead of a fixed height. |

#### New icons

For icons, use a comma-separated list instead of a bulleted list and start with the icon values. Icon names should be enclosed in backticks (`) and use the Ember value.

| Do | Dont |
|:---|:-----|
| `twitter-x`, `twitter-x-color`, `aws-cdk`, `aws-cdk-color`, `jfrog`, and `jfrog-color` icons added. | Added a new set of service icons: <ul><li>`twitter-x`</li><li>`twitter-x-color`</li><li>`aws-cdk`</li><li>`aws-cdk-color`</li><li>`jfrog`</li><li>`jfrog-color`</li></ul> |

## Templates

### Templates for npm packages

Copy and paste this template and adjust as necessary when creating a new [changeset](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system#changesets). _Replace all elements in brackets._

#### Simple entry
```
`{component-name}` - Fixed {...additional details}.
```

#### Multiple changes per element
```
`{component-name}` - Changed {...additional details}, including:
- {change 1}
- {change 2}
- etc

_{additional details}..._
```

#### Multiple elements changed
```
`{component-#1-name}` - Changed {...additional details}, including:
- {change 1}
- {change 2}

`{component-#2-name}` - Refactored {...additional details}

_{...important details}_
```

  `TooltipButton` - Added `text-align: inherit` to the “button” element.
  
  `Dropdown` - Fixed a few accessibility failures, including:
  - Added `aria-hidden` to the separator,
  - Added `role=“none”` to the checkbox `<li>`.
    
  `Table` - Changed `height` to `min-height` for the table head cells and updated the cells' internal padding to align with the design specs in Figma.
  
  `Sidenav Link` - Fixed an issue resulting in an empty node.
  - This will lead to a minimal visual impact on some edge cases of `Alert` and `Toast` (multiple description items) and `Sidenav` (text and generic content).
  
  `Standalone Link` - Increased the space between the actions to 16px and reduced the size of the icon in the small variant to 12px.
  `Modal` and `Flyout` - Fixed the scroll management resulting in stray `style` attribute on the `<body>` element.
  Updated the CSS of multiple components to use flex `gap`.
  Upgraded Ember.js to the latest stable release 4.12, including upgrades to:
  - `ember-auto-import` from `2.6.0` to `2.6.3`
  - `ember-cli-htmlbars` from `6.1.0` to `6.2.0`
  
  Upgraded the following dependencies:
  - `ember-focus-trap` from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`
  - `ember-keyboard` from `8.1.0` to `8.2.0`
  - `ember-truth-helpers` from `3.0.0` to `3.1.1`
  - `sass` from `1.58.3` to `1.62.1`
  
  Shifted our support version of Node.js from `12.* || 14.* || >= 16` to `14.* || 16.* || >= 18`

### Templates for Figma changelog entries

Entries made for the Figma Components and Foundations UI Kits require a few additional steps. Copy and paste this template and adjust as necessary after publishing changes in Figma. _Replace all elements in brackets._

#### Simple entry
```
### {month day, year}

`{component-name}` - Fixed {...additional details}.
```

#### Multiple changes per element
```
### {month day, year}

`{component-name}` - Changed {...additional details}, including:
- {change 1}
- {change 2}
- etc

_{additional details}..._
```

#### Breaking changes
```
### {month day, year}

#### Breaking change

`{component-name}` - Changed {...additional details}.
