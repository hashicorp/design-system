// PREFERS COLOR SCHEME

// this works because the specificity of `:root` is 010, the same as a class-based and an attribute-based selector; when specificity is equal, the later rules override earlier ones due to cascade order

// CSS SELECTORS

// after testing different options, we have decided to rely on `hds-` selectors instead of custom `shw-` selectors
// to avoid extra un-necessary complexity (see different attempts in https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/3240)
