<!-- START components/application-state -->

`ApplicationState` - Replaced the default opinionated `margin: 0 auto;` rule from the component's root element and replaced it with a new `@isAutoCentered` argument (which defaults to `true, to preserve the existing centering behavior) to delegate the horizontal alignment control to the consumers, allowing them to disable it when needed.
