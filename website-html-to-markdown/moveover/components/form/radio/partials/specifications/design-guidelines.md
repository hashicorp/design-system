## When to use

- To allow users to select a single option from a group of two or more mutually exclusive options.

## When not to use

- When a user should check and uncheck an option, use a [Checkbox](/components/form/checkbox/overview).
- When users need to select more than one option from a list, use a [Checkbox](/components/form/checkbox/overview).
- When the result of checking or unchecking the option is expected to happen immediately, use a [Toggle](/components/form/toggle/overview).

## Layout

We recommend using **vertical** checkbox groups, especially with short list options.

### Vertical

<section>
  <Hds::Form::Radio::Group @layout="vertical" @name="group" as |G|>
    <G.Legend>Group label</G.Legend>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
  </Hds::Form::Radio::Group>
</section>

### Horizontal

<section>
  <Hds::Form::Radio::Group @layout="horizontal" @name="group" as |G|>
    <G.Legend>Group label</G.Legend>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
  </Hds::Form::Radio::Group>
</section>

## Required and optional

It is recommended to always select one of the radio buttons by default. However, there could be cases where the default selection could affect the userâ€™s choice (the power of suggestion) and leaving all radio buttons unselected may provide a better user experience. Required and optional indicators can be used in those instances.

<section>
  <Hds::Form::Radio::Group @isRequired={{true}} @layout="vertical" @name="group" as |G|>
    <G.Legend>Group label</G.Legend>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
  </Hds::Form::Radio::Group>
</section>

<section>
  <Hds::Form::Radio::Group @isOptional={{true}} @layout="vertical" @name="group" as |G|>
    <G.Legend>Group label</G.Legend>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Label</F.Label>
    </G.Radio::Field>
  </Hds::Form::Radio::Group>
</section>

### Best practices

- For complex forms, indicate **required** fields. this is the most explicit and transparent method and ensures users don't have to make assumptions.
- For shorter, simpler forms (ie. login/signup and feedback requests), indicate **optional** fields.

## Validation

_Banner (warning):_ While we provide the structure and visual consistency for validation, the messaging and functionality are to be handled by the application teams.

<section>
  <Hds::Form::Radio::Group @layout="vertical" @name="delete-options" as |G|>
    <G.Legend>Delete options</G.Legend>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Delete this version</F.Label>
      <F.HelperText>This deletes version x of the variables.</F.HelperText>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Destroy this version</F.Label>
      <F.HelperText>Version x is permenantly destroyed and cannot be read or recovered later.</F.HelperText>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Radio::Field as |F|>
      <F.Label>Destroy all versions</F.Label>
      <F.HelperText>All versions and metadata are permenantly destroyed and cannot be read or recovered later.</F.HelperText>
    </G.Radio::Field>
    <G.Error>Select a delete option</G.Error>
  </Hds::Form::Radio::Group>
</section>

### Client side and Server side validation

Use a combination of client side and server side validation for the best user experience. Catching basic erros with client side validation allows the user to quickly resolve the error **before** submitting the form.

#### Client side (or inline) validation

Client side validation is an initial check that happens in the browser to ensure required fields are filled out and that the value is in the correct format.

[More about client side validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)

![Example of client side (inline) validation](/assets/components/general/validation-client_side.png)

#### Server side validation

Server side validation provides a more thorough check on the server once the data has been submitted and helps keep our applications safe.

When using server side validation, display a Critical [AlertInline](/components/alerts/overview) above the form listing all errors with links to each invalid field.

## Content

### Label

- We recommend keeping labels clear and concise.
- [3.2.2 Labels or Instructions (A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html): Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.

_Banner (informational):_ Labels and link: Labels are part of the checkbox's selectable area, making them interactive elements. This means that links inside them are nested interactive elements and cannot be reached by assistive technology. If you plan to add links to checkboxes, please contact the design system team for guidance.

### Helper text

- Use helper text when needing to provide the user with extra details about the option(s) you're asking them to select, ie. Learn more about our pricing.

### Error messages

- Error messages need to provide the user with enough context to guide them in resolving the error.
- Keep messages short and to the point.
  - ie. "Select at least one option"
- Avoid over politeness; don't use 'please' or 'thank you' in your messages.
- [3.3.1 Error Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-identification.html): If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text.
- [3.3.3 Error Suggestion (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-suggestion.html): If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.
- [3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data.html): For Web pages that cause legal commitments or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-contrallable data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true: submissions are reversible, data is checked and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them, a mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting the information before finalizing the submission.
- [4.1.4 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages.html): In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without recieving focus.
