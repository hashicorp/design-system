## Components library

---
applyTo: "packages/components/src/components/hds/**"
description: "Instructions for how components should be built and used."
---

### Component structure

#### Required files
- `index.ts` - Primary entry point for the component, exporting the main component class and types.
- `index.hbs` - Handlebars template for the component.

#### Supplemental files
- `types.ts` - TypeScript types for the component's arguments and blocks.
- `{subcomponent-name}.ts` - Entry point for subcomponents, exporting the main subcomponent class and types.
- `{subcomponent-name}.hbs` - Handlebars template for the subcomponent

### Code formatting

#### Arguments
- Define all arguments in the `Args` interface.
- Use camelCase for argument names.
- Use the `argument?: type` syntax.

#### Class names
- Use the `hds-<component-name>` prefix for all class names in component template files, TS functions, and SCSS files.
- Use BEM methodology for class names, where the block is the component name, elements are separated by double underscores (`__`), and modifiers are separated by double dashes (`--`).
  - Good examples
    - `hds-component-name__element--modifier`
    - `hds-component-name__title`
    - `hds-component-name--color-primary`
  - Bad examples
   - `hds-component-name-element`
   - `hdsComponentName`
- Use a consistent naming structure throughout all of a component's files.

## CSS and SCSS styling
---
applyTo: "packages/components/src/styles/components/**"
description: "Instructions for how CSS styles should be written"
---

### File structure
- `{component-name}.scss` - Main SCSS file for the component, containing styles for the component.
- `{component-name}/index.scss` - Main SCSS file for the component, importing any subcomponent styles from files in the same folder.

### Additional info
- The CSS variables for the tokens package are compiled in the `packages/tokens/dist/products/css/tokens.css` file.

### Code formatting
- Do not include any unused style blocks
- Use the class names rules listed above for all class names

#### HDS tokens
- Use CSS variables from the HDS design tokens for colors, typography, elevation, and border radius. These variables are defined in the `packages/tokens/dist/products/css/tokens.css`.
- Do not use hardcoded values for colors, typography, elevation, and border radius when HDS tokens can be used instead.
- Use HDS token names that are accurate and available in the tokens package.

## Exports
---
applyTo: "packages/components/src/**"
description: "Instructions for how components should be exported and registered in the components library"
---

## Relevant files
- `packages/components/src/components.ts` - Main entry point for the components library, exporting all components and types.
- `packages/components/src/template-registry.ts` - Template registry file, registering all components for use in Ember applications.

### Requirements
- Export all component classes and types defined under `packages/components/src/components/hds/**` in the `packages/components/src/components.ts` file.
  - Example: The `HdsButton` component should be exported as follows:
    ```ts
    export { default as HdsButton } from './components/hds/button/index.ts';
    export * from './components/hds/button/types.ts';
    ```
- Import all components defined under `packages/components/src/components/hds/**` in the `packages/components/src/template-registry.ts` file, and add their registration to the `HdsComponentsRegistry` interface.
  - Example: The `HdsButton` component should be registered as follows:
    ```ts
    import type HdsButtonComponent from './components/hds/button';

    export default interface HdsComponentsRegistry {
      // Button
      'Hds::Button': typeof HdsButtonComponent;
      'hds/button': typeof HdsButtonComponent;
    }
    ```

## Showcase

---
applyTo: "showcase/app/**"
description: "Instructions for how components should be displayed in the showcase application"
---

### File structure
- Define a folder for every component under `showcase/app`.

#### Required files
- `comtrollers/page-components/<component-name>.js` - Controller for the component's showcase page.
- `routes/page-components/<component-name>.js` - Route for the component's showcase page
- `templates/page-components/<component-name>.hbs` - Handlebars template for the component's showcase page.

Compare a component's showcase against its corresponding component in the `packages/components/src/components/hds` folder.

### Showcase template
For a given component, make the showcase template file include:
- Instances of all available arguments, and all available values for the component.
  - Example: An `@isActive` boolean argument should be demonstrated with both `true` and `false` values.
  - Example: A `@color` argument should be demonstrated with all available color values.
- Instances of all available blocks for the component.

### Component routes
- Include all pages under the `showcase/app/templates/page-components` folder in the `showcase/app/router.ts` file.
- Define a route with the format `this.route('component-name');` for each component.

## Testing

---
applyTo: "showcase/tests/**"
description: "Instructions for how components should be tested"
---

### File structure
- Define a folder for every component under `showcase/tests`.

#### Required files
- `acceptance/components/hds/<component-name>.js` - Acceptance test for the component.
- `integration/components/hds/<component-name>/index-test.js` - Integration test for the component.

Compare a component's test suite against its corresponding component in the `packages/components/src/components/hds/component-name` folder.

### Acceptance testing
- Call `allyAudit` to check for accessibility issues.

### Integration testing

#### Context
Tests use the qunit library and format. A component's integration tests should be defined in a file under `showcase/tests/integration/components/hds/<component-name>/index-test.js`.

### Formtting rules
- Test the component renders with a CSS class that matches the component name
- Test each argument is tested for all possible values
  - A list of arguments for a component can be found in the `packages/components/src/components/hds/<component-name>/index.ts` file.
  - Boolean arguments should be tested with both `true` and `false`
  - Enum arguments should be tested with all possible values
- Test each block in the Blocks interface
- Test each funtion or keyboard interaction

### Percy visual regeression testing
---
applyTo: "showcase/tests/acceptance/percy-test.js"
description: "Instructions for how components should be tested with Percy visual regression testing"
---
#### Context
The `tests/acceptance/percy-test.js` file defines what components are tested with Percy visual regression testing.

#### Requirements
- For all components with acceptance tests in the `showcase/tests/acceptance/components/hds` folder, add them to the list of Percy snapshots in the `tests/acceptance/percy-test.js` file.
- Use the `percySnapshot` function to take a snapshot of the component. Example: `percySnapshot('ComponentName');`

## Changelog entries

---
applyTo: ".changeset/**"
description: "Instructions for how to write changelog entries"
---

### Context
All changelog entries are creating using changesets. All upcoming changeset files are located in the `.changesets` folder.

### Template format
Each changeset entry should follow the following template:
```
<!-- START {components/path} -->
`{component-name}` - Fixed {...additional details}.
<!-- END -->
```

### Requirements
- Include a description of the change, including any relevant details.
- List the component name associated with a change in the format:
```
`ComponentName` - Ddescription of the change.
```
- Add an HTML comment on a new line before the change with the format `<!-- START components/path -->`to indicate the start of the entry.
- Add an HTML comment on a new line after the change with the format `<!-- END -->`to indicate the end of the entry.

### Formatting
- Always start an entry with a paragraph, not a list
- Use a list instead of a long paragraph of text to communicate multiple changes for one element
- If there are changes to multiple components in the same entry, described each change in a new paragraph (and a list of details, if needed)
- Add any additional notes to the bottom of the entry in a new paragraph
- Use complete sentences but be short, clear, and descriptive enough to be helpful
- Use past tense
- End entries with a period

#### Consistent terminology
- Use consistent terms for different types of changes:
  - Bugfix: “Fixed”
  - New component, token, variant: “Added”
  - Update: “Changed”, “Refactored”
  - Removed or deleted: “Removed”
  - Other possible cases: “Upgraded”, “Reduced”, “Prevented”

#### Component references
- When referencing components, use the plain-text component name, e.g., Accordion.
- Enclose all components or token names, including those in the summary, in backticks (`).
