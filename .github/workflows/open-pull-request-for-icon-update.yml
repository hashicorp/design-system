            ### :pushpin: Summary

            This is an automated PR opened by the Hashibot-HDS using the GitHub Action [Sync & Build Icons](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/actions/workflows/open-pull-request-for-icon-update.yml).

            ### :hammer_and_wrench: Detailed description

            <!-- (Remove this comment) once done ------------

            Add specific details for this PR here:
            - which icons has been added?
            - which icons have been changed, updated or deleted?

            Make sure that you have followed the instructions described here:
            https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/blob/main/packages/flight-icons/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-the-icons-in-flight-icons ("Updating the icons in flight-icons" + "Automated process" + "After you have run the scripts")

            Make sure that the "changeset" is added to the PR _before_ asking for review (and especially don't merge to `main` if the changeset is missing).

            ⚠️ Note: The changeset needs to be applied only to the `@hashicorp/flight-icons` version (typically a new icon or a significant change to an existing icon is considered a `minor` change, a breaking change is always considered a `major`, while for a small update to an icon a `patch` is OK). No need to bump also the version of `ember-flight-icons`: changesets takes care of everything from there (see for example this previous export: https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1638/files).
