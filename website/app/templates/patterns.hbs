    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">What is a pattern?</h2>
    <p class="doc-text-body">A pattern is a combination of components that work together to accomplish a function or render a layout. They are often used to solve the same problem consistently. Common examples of patterns are forms, navigation, button sets, etc.</p>
    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">HDS pattern support</h2>
    <p class="doc-text-body">We don't currently support patterns, but we have a few on our <a href="https://go.hashi.co/hds-rollout">roadmap</a>. We're also planning to introduce guidelines and best practices around assembling components in a consistent and scalable manner.</p>
    <p class="doc-text-body">If you find yourself building the same pattern often, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpMXgrUTVT5fYriu4Pp48r4Nl_eCPluVnJLg0Yg3NXsRWvIA/viewform">submit a new pattern request</a>.</p>
