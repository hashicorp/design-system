    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">Overview</h2>

      Figma components, web components, documentation, and more. Read through our
      <a href="/about/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview</a>
      for more details, and to see why adopting the HashiCorp Design System is the future for product teams.</p>

    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">Principles</h2>
    <p class="doc-text-body">It’s important that we stay focused and grounded as a team. Setting clear expectations for
      both ourselves and our consumers by defining our philosophy and values through our
      <a href="/about/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">principles</a>
      help us do just that.</p>

    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">Accessibility statement</h2>
    <p class="doc-text-body">Accessibility is not just a requirement, it is a part of our company culture, grounded in
      <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/our-principles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our company
        principles</a>
      such as integrity, communication, and kindness. Read more about our intentions for an accessible design system in

    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">Getting started for engineers</h2>
    <p class="doc-text-body">While the design system components are conveniently packaged in a standard Ember addon, we
      still recommend reading through our guide to
      <a href="/getting-started/for-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting started for engineers</a>
      to better understand some specific conventions we have put in place to help engineers focus on what is really
      important in their application, instead of thinking about component APIs.</p>

    <h2 class="doc-text-h2">Contributions</h2>
    <p class="doc-text-body">As an open-source project, we think a lot about how people can contribute—and there are
      quite a few ways our consumers are encouraged to participate! Read our
      <a href="/getting-started/contribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contribution</a>
      documentation to find the different ways anyone can contribute to Helios.</p>
