!!! Warning

Adoption plans for “Enterprise Nav” related components which include the `AppHeader` and the `AppSideNav` has been deprioritized at this time. Therefore, we currently do not recommend usage in production.

!!!

The App Side Nav provides users with access to contextual navigation within areas of the application and generally includes subpages and nested pages within projects and organizations.

!!! Info

The App Side Nav replaces the former Side Nav component. It is designed to always be used together with the App Header component unlike the former Side Nav which was originally created as a standalone navigation component before the introduction of the App Header.
