## Actions

- Modal actions should be concise and not written as sentences. Most of the time, one or two words are adequate for an action. 
- We generally donâ€™t recommend using icons on actions within Modals.
- Buttons in a Modal should follow the same content guidelines as the [Button](/components/button) component.
