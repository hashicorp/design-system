## Conformance

<Doc::Badge @type="success">Conformant</Doc::Badge>

The Modal component is conformant when used as directed.

## Focus and focus order

- When the Modal is triggered via the keyboard, focus is trapped within the Modal.
  - If there are no interactive elements within the body of the Modal the dismiss button should receive focus as the first interactive element in the [DOM (document object model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
  - If there is an interactive element within the body of the Modal (like a form input or link), that element should be targeted for focus first.
- Since a Modal is a complex pattern that can contain any combination of nested components and content, nested elements must adhere to their individual accessibility criteria.

### Focus order within a simple Modal

Given the Modal is triggered via a keyboard, the dismiss button is first in the focus order since there isnâ€™t any content within the body that is eligible to receive focus.

### Focus order within a complex Modal

- If the Modal body contains interactive content, the first element should receive focus first.
- This is true regardless of how the Modal is triggered; either via a mouse click or via the keyboard.
