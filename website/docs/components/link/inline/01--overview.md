The `Link::Inline` component handles the generation of:

*   an HTML anchor element `<a>` that points to an external URL (when using a `@href` argument)
*   an [Ember component](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/linking-between-routes/#toc_the-linkto--component) `<LinkTo>` that points to an internal application link or resource (when using a `@route` argument)

#### Why it's called "inline"

A **"Link Inline"** is a link that's used within a body of text.

##### Example of Link (Inline):

Here's a Link (Inline) that is inline with adjacent text. And this is another Link (Inline) with an icon too.
