## Best Practices

### Annotations in design

Include annotations of the non-visual experience in your handoff notes. For example:

![Annotation of focus order of the link](/assets/components/link/standalone/link-annotation.png =440x*)

### Interactive transitions

Animations or transitions will not take place if the user has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled in their browser.
