## Best Practices

### Annotations

Provide annotations alongside each design of the non-visual experience. This could look like:

![Annotation of focus order of the link](/assets/components/link/standalone/link_standalone-accessibility-focus_order.png)

!!! Info

Animations or transitions will not take place if the user has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled in their browser.
