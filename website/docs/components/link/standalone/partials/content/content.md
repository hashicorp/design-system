## General recommendations

- Text should be short and to the point (~25 characters). Text labels should not consist of full sentences but should provide enough context to be useful.
- Use language consistently within each product (e.g., if “Edit” is used on one page, use that same convention throughout, instead of a similar word such as "Change").
