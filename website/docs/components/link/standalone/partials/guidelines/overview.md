The Standalone Link handles the generation of:

- an HTML anchor element `<a>` that points to an external URL (when using a `@href` argument)
- an [Ember component `<LinkTo>`](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/linking-between-routes/#toc_the-linkto--component) that points to an internal application link or resource (when using a `@route` argument)
