The `Link::Standalone` component handles the generation of:

*   an HTML anchor element `<a>` that points to an external URL (when using a `@href` argument)
*   an [Ember component](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/linking-between-routes/#toc_the-linkto--component) `<LinkTo>` that points to an internal application link or resource (when using a `@route` argument)
