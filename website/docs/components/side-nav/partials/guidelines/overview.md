The Side Nav provides users with access to contextual navigation within areas of the application and generally includes subpages and nested pages within projects and organizations.

!!! Info

Some elements that were previously contained within the Side Nav, including the home link, help dropdown, user dropdown, and context switcher, have been migrated to the [App Header](/components/app-header). To avoid introducing a breaking change, weâ€™ve created a Side Nav - v2.0 component that should be used along with App Header. In Ember, the elements removed were yielded in the component, incurring no breaking change.
