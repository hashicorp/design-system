## Usage

### When to use

- When navigating between subpages and nested pages within the application.

### When not to use

- For global navigation across an application, use the [App Header](/components/app-header) instead.
- To move between views within the same context or page, consider [Tabs](/components/tabs).

## Body

The body consists of a group of sections with vertical lists of links, typically to the most important parts of the application. Any custom content or component is also supported by an additional generic container.

### List

#### With title

#### Without title

![Side-nav section without a title](/assets/components/side-nav/section-without-title.png)

- A title can help users scan the sections and provide context about the links inside each section.
- Titles should be meaningful and related to the content within the section.

### List items

#### Without icon

#### With icon

![List items with icons](/assets/components/side-nav/list-item-with-icon.png)

- Use icons to help users recognize and scan the links they are paired with.
- We recommend only using icons in the main or top level navigation.
- Avoid overwriting color styles in icons.

#### With nested items

Use `hasSubItems` to show or signify that a link has a nested level of navigation.

#### External links

Use `isLinkExternal` to show that the list item is a hyperlink pointing to a page outside the product or platform.

!!! Warning

Use external links sparingly. Avoid using this property to link pages that are unrelated to the product's navigation.
!!!

### Custom content

Toggle `hasCustomContent` on to support any additional custom content, local components, or Helios components within the body container via an instance swap property (customInstance) in Figma.

## Positioning, and responsive behaviour

The Side Nav should always be positioned on the left side of the viewport, occupying 100% of the viewport height to ensure that the navigation is always visible and accessible to the user..

On smaller viewports, the Side Nav should collapse to maximize the available real estate on tablet and mobile devices. By tapping the menu icon, users can expand and access the full menu when needed.

## Collapse functionality

If the `isCollapsible` property is set to `true`, a collapse toggle button will be exposed to the end-user allowing them to manually expand and collapse the component.

![Side Nav collapse function](/assets/components/side-nav/sidenav-collapse-interaction.png)

On smaller viewports, the Side Nav will be rendered in its collapsed state **by default** and will overlay the main page content in its expanded state.

### Collapsed reflow

The collapse functionality of the Side Nav gives control to the end-user to unlock more horizontal space in the main page. Thus, the main page content should reflow or reposition to occupy this space if the Side Nav is in its collapsed state. If the main page content has a predetermined maximum width that is reached when the Side Nav collapses, the content should transition smoothly to the new center of the main page area.

This is handled out of the box by the [AppFrame](/layouts/app-frame) component, but may need to be accounted for in custom implementations of the application/page layout.
