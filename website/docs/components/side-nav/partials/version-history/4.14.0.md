## 4.14.0

### Updated

`SideNav`

- Made a11y related improvements including:
  - Changed `List::Title` to h3 & added visually hidden h2 to AppSideNav
  - Replaced aria-label for `ToggleButton` with aria-labelledby and aria-expanded
- Fixed bug with hidden panels sometimes causing unnecessary overflow scrolling.

### Deprecated

`SideNav`

Deprecated the `ariaLabel` argument as it is no longer needed. Its purpose is replaced by an added `aria-labelledby` attribute referencing the "hds-side-nav-header" `h2` combined with the use of `aria-expanded` on the Toggle button tab.
