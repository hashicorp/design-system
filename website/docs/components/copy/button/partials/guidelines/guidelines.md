## Usage

### When to use

- Use the `CopyButton` to quickly copy big text blocks, like code or API keys. 

- Use when a user may need to copy data, like tokens or URLs within content. 

### When not to use

- Don't use the `CopyButton` for easily copied, minor text strings. 

- Don't use if automatic copying might overwrite valuable clipboard content, leading to data loss or inconvenience.

### Sizes
 
 Medium is the preferred size, but use a `CopyButton` size that best fits the UI (e.g., donâ€™t use a medium sized `CopyButton` in a small code block).

### Icon position

`CopyButtons` are provided with two icon uses; allowing for trailing or icon only `CopyButtons`. 

## Content

Text should be short and to the point (~25 characters). `CopyButtons` should not consist of full sentences, but should provide enough context to be useful.
Language should be used consistently within each product (e.g., when using "Copy" on one page, use that same convention throughout the rest of the application, not "Duplicate").
