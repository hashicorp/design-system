## How to use this component

The basic invocation requires `textToCopy` to be passed:

[[code-snippets/copy-snippet-basic]]

### Color

There are two available colors for the component: `primary` and `secondary`. The default is `primary`.

[[code-snippets/copy-snippet-color]]

### Full-width

This indicates that the component should take up the full-width of the parent container. It’s set to `false` by default.

[[code-snippets/copy-snippet-full-width]]

### Truncation

When set to `true`, this constrains text to one-line and truncates it if it does not fit the available space.

Please be aware there are [serious accessibility concerns](/components/copy/snippet?tab=accessibility) with using this feature.
