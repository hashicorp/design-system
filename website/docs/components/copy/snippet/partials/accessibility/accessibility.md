## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Conditionally Conformant</Doc::Badge>

When the default variant of the component is used, there should not be any WCAG conformance issues.

However, the truncation feature is not conformant because a keyboard-only user cannot access the truncated content. Please be aware of this when evaluating whether or not to include truncation in your copy snippet.
