## Accessibility considerations

Years of misuse have muddled the purpose of a button element vs. a link element, so here is a good rule of thumb to follow:

If it _goes to a URL_, use a link. If it does an _action_ (toggles a state, submits a form, etc.), then use a button.

Now, you may be thinking, “What about instances where I submit a form and redirect a user to a different URL?” This is still a button use case.

Buttons and links especially make a difference for keyboard-only users and users with assistive technology (AT). A button element can be activated with the `Enter/Return` key _or_ the `Spacebar`; a link can only be activated with the `Enter/Return` key.

If you are working on a UI that already uses buttons and links interchangeably, this is a great opportunity for a team discussion on which one is appropriate for use in your situation. It’s totally okay for it to be a goal that you work toward; there are always opportunities to care for, and improve, our code.
