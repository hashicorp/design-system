## General recommendations

- Text should be short and to the point (~25 characters). Buttons should not consist of full sentences, but should provide enough context to be useful.
- Language should be used consistently within each product (e.g., when using "Edit" on one page, use that same convention throughout the rest of the application, not "Change").
