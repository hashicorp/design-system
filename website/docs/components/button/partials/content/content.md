## General recommendations

- Text should be short and to the point (~25 characters). Buttons should provide enough context to be useful; often a single verb will convey the action sufficiently.
- Language should be used consistently within each product (e.g., when using "Edit" on one page, use that same convention throughout the rest of the application, not "Change").
