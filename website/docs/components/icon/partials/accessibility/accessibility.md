## Browser accessibility support

Accessibility support for SVGs is inconsistent across browsers and assistive technology. Currently, the best practice is to set the `aria-hidden` attribute to `true` on the SVG itself (as we do by default for the `Hds::Icon` component). This means that the icon (both the singular icon and the icon component) will need to be used _in context_. The icons themselves are for presentation purposes only and should never be used on their own.

```markup
<h2>
  Activity report <Hds::Icon @name="activity" />
</h2>
```

If you make a custom element, or want to use a `Hds::Icon` inside of a native HTML element like a `<button>` element, ensure that an `aria-label` attribute is added, like this:

```markup
<button aria-label="Check activity">
  <Hds::Icon @name="activity" />
</button>
```
