## What is an icon

An icon is used to provide visual flourish to text, and in some rare contexts meaning on its own.

In the context of the HDS components there is an important distinction to make:

- in Figma the term "icon" can be used interchangeably to indicate the Figma component and the visual element itself (or "glyph")
- in code the "icon" as glyph is nothing more than an `<svg>` HTML element, while the `Hds::Icon` is the actual Ember component that renders the `<svg>` element.

You can see all the available icons ("glyphs") in [our icon library](/icons/library), also known as Flight Icons library.
