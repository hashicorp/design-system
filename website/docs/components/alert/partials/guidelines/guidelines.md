## Usage

### When to use

- To display a concise, important message that requires the user’s attention.

### When not to use

- To communicate successful feedback on a user’s action, consider [Toast](/components/toast).
- As a dialog to confirm an action, consider [Modal](/components/modal).
- To flag new features (e.g., "In Preview", "Beta", "New", etc), consider [Badge](/components/badge).

## Types of alerts

There are three types of alerts: page, inline, and compact.

### Page

Use page-level alerts on the top of the page, between the navigation and the breadcrumb to inform users of an event that may require the user’s attention or action.

### Inline

Use inline alerts when the message is contextual or specific to the section it’s placed in.

### Compact

Use compact alerts when a less prominent alert is needed.

### Ordering Alerts by type

Alert types have an implied hierarchy and should be ordered starting from `page` and descending in hierarchy to `compact`.

## Color

<Doc::Layout @spacing="12px">
  <Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="neutral" as |A|>
    <A.Title>Neutral alert title</A.Title>
    <A.Description>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amet.</A.Description>
  </Hds::Alert>
  <Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="highlight" as |A|>
    <A.Title>Highlight alert title</A.Title>
    <A.Description>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amet.</A.Description>

Use color logically.

- **Neutral** to provide general information to the user regarding the current context or relevant actions.
- **Highlight** to provide general or promotional information to the user prominently.
- **Success** to indicate a successful action.
  - Use the success variant sparingly. To communicate success after a user action is performed, use [Toast](/components/toast).
- **Warning** to help users avoid an issue. Provide guidance and actions, if possible.
- **Critical** to indicate critical errors that need immediate action.

### Critical alerts

Use critical alerts to convey crucial information or errors, such as validation errors that require user attention or action.

!!! Do

Use the Alert for more intrusive message communication about errors or critical disruptions at an application, page, or section level where users need to take immediate action.

<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="critical" as |A|>
  <A.Title>You have exceeded 50 applies this month</A.Title>
  <A.Description>You may only invoke applies that destroy managed resources. Upgrade now and access additional product features, unlimited applies, and increased concurrency.</A.Description>
  <A.Button @text="Upgrade" @color="secondary" @onClick={{this.noop}} />
  <A.LinkStandalone @color="secondary" @icon="arrow-right" @iconPosition="trailing" @text="View usage" @href="#" />
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

!!! Do

Use the Alert to communicate validation errors. For more details, refer to the [form validation patterns](/patterns/form-patterns?tab=validation).

<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="critical" as |A|>
  <A.Title>Form submission error</A.Title>
  <A.Description>Correct the formatting of the following fields to update your user profile:
  </A.Description>
  <A.Description>
  <Hds::Link::Inline @href="..." @color="secondary">Email address</Hds::Link::Inline>
  </A.Description>
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

!!! Dont

Don't use alerts to provide non-intrusive feedback to users about the failure of an ongoing task or request. For example, a failure while deleting a cluster. Use the [Toast](/components/toast) instead.

<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="critical" as |A|>
  <A.Title>Module error</A.Title>
  <A.Description>This module encountered an error during publishing. You may need to republish.
  </A.Description>
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

!!! Dont

Don't use alerts to communicate error messages that are not caused by the user. For example, an unsuccessful Vault cluster creation due to a failure while validating the deployment. Use the [Toast](/components/toast) instead.

<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="critical" as |A|>
  <A.Title>Vault cluster update failed</A.Title>
  <A.Description>**test-cluster_1** configuration update failed.</A.Description>
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

### Ordering Alerts by color

Order multiple Alerts by their importance and impact on the user, starting from `critical`, to communicate an Alert that must be resolved immediately, and descending in order of perceived impact to `neutral`.

![Ordering alerts](/assets/components/alert/ordering-alerts-color.png)

## Placing Alerts

`Inline` and `compact` Alerts can have more meaning if they are placed within the element that is responsible for the Alert. This can help when it’s necessary to have more than one Alert on the page and is relevant for pages that aggregate content like dashboards, or where a specific localized message is necessary.

![Example of multiple Alerts placed to different parts of the UI](/assets/components/alert/combining-contextualized-alerts.png)

### Placement by type

Where an Alert is placed is dependent on the type.

#### Page

Page alerts are placed between the global header navigation and the breadcrumb, next to the left navigation.

![Placement of page alert](/assets/components/alert/alert-placement-page.png =600x*)

#### Inline

Inline alerts can be added to a section or component or inline with content.

![Placement of inline alert](/assets/components/alert/alert-placement-inline.png =600x*)

#### Compact

Compact alerts can be added to a section or component or inline with content.

![Placement of compact Alert](/assets/components/alert/alert-placement-compact.png =600x*)

#### Mixing Alert types

We recommend against mixing different types of Alerts in the same context, as this can unintentionally convey that different Alert types have the same hierarchical impact.

!!! Dont

Don’t mix different Alert types in the same context.

![Example of different Alert types in the same context](/assets/components/alert/mixing-alert-types-dont.png)
!!!

!!! Do

Instead, be more specific with how the Alerts are placed depending on what the message applies to.

## Icons

All alerts have icons by default that are intentionally tied to the alert type.

Icons within the `neutral` and `highlight` alerts can be replaced with other icons. Change them only when the new icon provides the user with extra value; otherwise, use the default icon provided.

<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="highlight" @onDismiss={{this.noop}} @icon="gift" as |A|>
  <A.Title>New features available</A.Title>
  <A.Description>Starting with Terraform 0.15, you can now upgrade to a new version and your workflows will continue to be operational, just as they were in prior versions.</A.Description>
  <A.LinkStandalone @color="secondary" @icon="arrow-right" @iconPosition="trailing" @text="Release notes" @href="#" />
</Hds::Alert>

## Dismissal

### Persistent

All alerts are persistent by default, while compact alerts are always persistent.

### Dismissible

Page and inline alerts can be dismissible.

We recommend setting `neutral` and `highlight` alerts to be dismissible, as they are not critical for users to complete their journey.

!!! Do
<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="neutral" @onDismiss={{this.noop}} as |A|>
  <A.Title>Neutral alert title</A.Title>
  <A.Description>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amet.</A.Description>
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

We recommend keeping `critical` alerts non-dismissible as they are essential to the user’s journey and can get dismissed by mistake.

!!! Do
<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="critical" as |A|>
  <A.Title>Critical alert title</A.Title>
  <A.Description>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amet.</A.Description>
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

!!! Dont
<Hds::Alert @type="inline" @color="critical" @onDismiss={{this.noop}} as |A|>
  <A.Title>Critical alert title</A.Title>
  <A.Description>Lorem ipsum dolar sit amet.</A.Description>
</Hds::Alert>
!!!

## Multiple alerts

In general, displaying multiple alerts on the same page is discouraged as it can negatively impact the page hierarchy and unnecessarily shift emphasis away from the main content on the page.

However, depending on the logic within the application and the type of content being expressed to the user, displaying more than one Alert on a page may be necessary.

### Alerts of the same color

While it might not always be possible depending on the type of content and intended action, try to refrain from displaying more than one of the same `color` Alert on the same page. This adds unnecessary visual weight to the page and may result in the user being confused about which Alert is more important or which might require attention first.

![Example of multiple Alerts of the same color](/assets/components/alert/multiple-color-alerts-dont.png)

To avoid this, try combining relevant or overlapping content into a single Alert with a more concise narrative, or by translating the related messages into a list.

![Example of multiple Alerts combined into one](/assets/components/alert/multiple-color-alerts-do.png)

![Multiple Alert messages combined in a bulleted list](/assets/components/alert/multiple-color-alerts-do-bulleted-list.png)

### Alerts of the same type

While not recommended for `page` type Alerts, it may be necessary to have more than one `inline` or `compact` Alert on a page. If this is the case, ensure that the Alerts are [ordered](#ordering-of-alerts) by impact and [placed](#placing-alerts) in areas where they provide the most relevance.

### Alerts within a Reveal

**As a last resort**, when multiple Alerts of the same type are necessary, display the Alerts that require immediate attention or have the most impact to the user within the page while obfuscating additional Alerts within a [Reveal](/components/reveal). We recommend against hiding `critical` and `warning` Alerts in this manner as they generally must be addressed quickly to avoid a negative outcome.

!!! Warning

This method should be **rare and infrequent**, and should only be used if the number of Alerts of the same type exceeds two. Instead, effort should be put into placing Alerts that matter most to the user and in ways that make them easy to resolve.
!!!

This pattern is somewhat experimental, if you find a use case for it we recommend performing a usability test and collecting user feedback as a means to validate the pattern. The HDS team would love to discuss your findings through our normal [support channels](/about/support).
