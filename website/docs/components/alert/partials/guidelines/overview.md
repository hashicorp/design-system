Use alerts to display brief but important system-generated messages. They attract the user's attention without interrupting their task. For messages that are the result of a user's actions, see [Toast](/components/toast/).


## Types of alerts
There are three types of alerts: page, inline, and compact.

### Page
Use page-level alerts on the top of the page, between the navigation and the breadcrumb to inform users of an event that may require the user's attention or action.

### Inline
Use inline alerts when the message is contextual or specific to the section it is placed in.

### Compact
Use compact alerts when a less prominent alert is needed.
