Alerts display brief but important system-generated messages and capture the user's attention without interrupting their workflow. They excel in conveying crucial information or errors, such as validation errors that require user attention or action. Unlike [Toast](/components/toast), tailored for feedback on user actions, Alerts serve as the go-to component for more critical notifications.

## Types of alerts

There are three types of alerts: page, inline, and compact.

### Page

Use page-level alerts on the top of the page, between the navigation and the breadcrumb to inform users of an event that may require the user’s attention or action.

### Inline

Use inline alerts when the message is contextual or specific to the section it’s placed in.

### Compact

Use compact alerts when a less prominent alert is needed.
