Alerts display brief but important messages that capture the user's attention but doesn't interrupt their workflow. 

## Types of alerts

There are three types of alerts: page, inline, and compact.

### Page

Use page-level alerts on the top of the page, between the navigation and the breadcrumb to inform users of an event that may require the user’s attention or action.

### Inline

Use inline alerts when the message is contextual or specific to the section it’s placed in.

### Compact

Use compact alerts when a less prominent alert is needed.
