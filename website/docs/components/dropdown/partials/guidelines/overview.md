A dropdown displays a list of links or actions for the user to choose from. It should not to be confused with a select element which is used in forms as a way for the user to select an option from a list.

**Dropdown, Select, Context Switcher...oh my!**

**Dropdowns** work great for overflow menus, where supplementary actions can be hidden in a menu. Dropdowns can be identified by their button trigger and chevron icon.

**Select** elements are used in forms, when you need to provide the user with options to choose from.

**Context switchers** (coming soon) are ideal for selecting between different contexts within a single page, i.e., switching between versions, languages, etc. Here, it is the _design intention_ that differs; the code behind a context switcher and a dropdown menu are likely to be incredibly similar.
