A dropdown is a flexible component that displays a list of actions or options to the user. It should not be confused with [Select](/components/form/select), which is used in forms as a way for the user to make a selection from a list.

!!! Info

Take care to use dropdowns correctly. A crowded or overly complex dropdown can lead to a frustrating user experience, especially for assistive technology users. [Contact the Design Systems Team](/about/support) to discuss alternative options if a dropdown feels too complex.
