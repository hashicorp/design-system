!!! Info

**A note on disabled states** 

Because disabled states completely remove the interactive function of an element, it can be challenging for a user to understand why it has been disabled and/or why they cannot interact with that element. In an effort to avoid this confusion, we opt for using methods like enabling or hiding the element and, thus, are not offering a disabled state for the Dropdown Toggle. [Read more about when to enable vs hide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqsXjjPnz5HK2NcY1buh5RcI5S6XCgQwfr8GP3kClv0/edit#heading=h.52ub6bvbvcb7)
