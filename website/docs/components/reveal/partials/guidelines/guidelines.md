- To contain complex or advanced content.

## Toggle text

- Ensure that the text clearly describes the content that will be revealed when the toggle is triggered.
- Keep the text short, clear, and concise. Avoid long sentences.
- Use action-oriented language when possible to convey that there is additional content to be shown. e.g. Show more options.

## Content type

## Spacing

- We recommend 8px between the Reveal and the element or section it relates to.

- We recommend at least 24px below the Reveal.

In cases where surrounding elements already have margin or padding added, you may want to reduce or remove the spacing entirely.
