## Usage

### When not to use

- To hide information critical to the user’s task.
- To contain complex or advanced content.

## Toggle text

- Ensure that the text clearly describes the content that will be revealed when the toggle is triggered.
- Keep the text short, clear, and concise. Avoid long sentences.
- Use action-oriented language, when possible, to convey that there is additional content to be shown, e.g., “Show more options”.

## Spacing

- When using the Reveal to contain information related to a single element within a group or section, we recommend leaving 8px between the Reveal and the element it relates to.

- When used to show and hide information not directly associated with a single element but an entire section or group, we recommend leaving 24px between the Reveal and the section it relates to.

- If you need to adjust the spacing, always ensure it is slightly tighter compared to the spacing between other elements and components in the group, section, or page.

!!! Info

In cases where surrounding elements already have margin or padding added, you may want to reduce or remove the spacing entirely.
