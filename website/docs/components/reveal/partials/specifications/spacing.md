## Spacing

!!! Info

In cases where surrounding elements already have margin or padding added, you may want to reduce or remove the spacing entirely.
!!!

- When using the Reveal to contain information related to a single element within a group or section, we recommend leaving 8px between the Reveal and the element it relates to.

- When used to show and hide information not directly associated with a single element but an entire section or group, we recommend leaving 24px between the Reveal and the section it relates to.

- If you need to adjust the spacing, always ensure it is slightly tighter compared to the spacing between other elements and components in the group, section, or page.
