## Spacing

We recommend using meaningful spacing between content elements, allowing users to scan and understand information quickly.

- Use the `0px` spacing option for a tightly integrated layout without any visible gaps between elements.
- Use the `24px` spacing option to visually distinguish between different sections, making it simpler for users to navigate and understand the content.
