## How to use this component

The Separator renders a thematic break element (also known as horizontal rule, or `<hr/>` element) with equal top and bottom margins to create space between sections.

```handlebars
<Hds::Separator/>
```

### Spacing

The default spacing value is `24` pixels. If you need to use the Separator without margins set `@spacing` to `0`.

```handlebars
<Hds::Separator @spacing="0"/>
```
