## Usage

### When to use

- Use to visually separate different parts or sections on a page.
- Use it to create a clear break between paragraphs, blocks, or sections.

### When not to use

- Don't use to separate headings and body text. Instead, use our foundations to emphasize hierarchy. 

### Placement

We recommend using meaningful spacing between content elements, allowing users to scan and understand information quickly. Use separators sparingly and purposefully to avoid cluttering the UI and distracting users from the main content.
