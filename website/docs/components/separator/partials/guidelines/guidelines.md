## Placement

Use separators to distinguish between sections on a page visually. Use them sparingly and purposefully to avoid cluttering the UI and distracting users from the main content.

!!! Do

Use to create a clear break between paragraphs, blocks, or sections.

Donâ€™t use to separate headings and body text. Instead, emphasize hierarchy by using the proper [Display font style](https://helios.hashicorp.design/foundations/typography?tab=code#font-styles).

## Spacing

We recommend using meaningful spacing between content elements, allowing users to scan and understand information quickly.

### `0px` spacing
   - Use the `0px` spacing option for a tightly integrated layout without any visible gaps between elements.
  - Avoid using the `24px` spacing option when you require a tightly integrated layout or when limited vertical space is available.

### `24px` spacing
   - This option assists in visually distinguishing between different sections, making it simpler for users to navigate and understand the content.
- Similarly, avoid using the `0px` spacing option when the content sections need clear visual separation or when visual clutter is possible.
