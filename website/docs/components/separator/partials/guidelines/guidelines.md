## Placement

Use separators to distinguish between sections on a page visually. Use them sparingly and purposefully to avoid cluttering the UI and distracting users from the main content.

### Spacing

##### 0px Spacing:
   - This option works well when you want adjacent components to flow together smoothly without any interruptions in the visual presentation.
   - Use the 0px spacing option for a tightly integrated layout without any visible gaps between elements.
   - Avoid using the 0px spacing option when the content sections need clear visual separation or when visual clutter is possible.

##### 24px Spacing:
   - This option assists in visually distinguishing between different sections, making it simpler for users to navigate and understand the content.
   - Similarly, avoid using the 24px spacing option when you require a tightly integrated layout or when limited vertical space is available.
