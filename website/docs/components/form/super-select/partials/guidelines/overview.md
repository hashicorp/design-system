The Super Select component provides a way to select among a group of options and can be considered an enhanced version of the [Select](/components/form/select) component. It supports rich content within option items, as well as custom content before and after the option items. The Super Select is built on top of [ember-power-select](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-select).
