## States

!!! Info

**A note on disabled states**

Because disabled states completely remove the interactive function of an element, it can be challenging for a user to understand why it has been disabled and/or why they cannot interact with that element. In an effort to avoid this confusion, we opt for using methods like displaying or hiding the element. Read more about [when to enable vs hide](https://hashicorp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DES/pages/2678685874/Hiding+Disabling).
