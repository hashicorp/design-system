## States

### Readonly vs Disabled

- Readonly and disabled fields are not editable by the user.
- Data in readonly fields gets passed to the form, while data in disabled fields does not.
- If the user doesnâ€™t need to review the data, consider using a hidden field instead.
- Use these fields sparingly.
