**Accessibility consideration**

Because disabled states completely remove the interactive function of an element, it can be challenging for a user to understand why it has been disabled and/or why they cannot interact with that element. For this reason, we recommend using disabled fields sparingly and with intention. Instead, consider using methods like enabling or hiding the element.
