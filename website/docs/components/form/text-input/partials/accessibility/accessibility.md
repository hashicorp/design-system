## Conformance rating

### Form::TextInput::Field

<Doc::Badge @type="success">Conformant</Doc::Badge>

`Form::TextInput::Field` is conformant when used as directed. For this reason, we recommend using `Form::TextInput::Field` by default.

### Form::TextInput::Base

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Conditionally conformant</Doc::Badge>

`Form::TextInput::Base` is not conformant until it has an accessible name.

## Known issues

If a link is used within a label, helper text, or error text, it will not be presented as a link to the user with a screen reader; only the text content is read out. As such, care should be used when considering this feature.
