## Option list

- We recommend keeping options clear and concise; avoid full sentences.
- Avoid using the same word at the beginning of a set of options.
- Order the set of options in a logical way based on the use case. For example:

    - default or most commonly selected options first
    - alphabetically
    - numerically
