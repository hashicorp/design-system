A Select is a form element that provides users with a way to select amongst a set of options.

!!! Warning

**Code pitfalls**

It's not possible to customize options within this component as it is a native HTML element and uses browser defaults to render it. Find more information [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select).
