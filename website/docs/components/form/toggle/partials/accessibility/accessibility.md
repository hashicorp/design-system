#### Known Issues

**Links within labels, help text, or error text:** If a link is used within a label, helper text, or error text, it will not be presented as a link to the user with a screen reader; only the text content is read out. As such, it is generally preferable to avoid links within help/error text or labels; however, we understand that this may not be avoidable in some cases. Please use sparingly until a good known alternative approach is determined.
