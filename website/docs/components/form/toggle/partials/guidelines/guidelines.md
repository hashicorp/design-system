## Usage

### When to use

- To allow users to turn on and off two mutually exclusive options providing an immediate response.

### When not to use

- When users could check and uncheck an option, consider [Checkbox](/components/form/checkbox).
- When users need to select more than one option from a list, consider [Checkbox](/components/form/checkbox).
- When only one choice can be selected, consider [Radio](/components/form/radio) buttons.

## Required and optional

For complex forms, indicate required fields. This is the most explicit and transparent method and ensures users don’t have to make assumptions. Read more about best practices for [marking required fields in forms](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/).
