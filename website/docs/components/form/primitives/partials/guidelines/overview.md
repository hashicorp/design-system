We use Form Primitives as the building blocks for the “field” and “group” controls. While we recommend using our pre-defined “field” and “group” controls because they provide built-in accessibility support, you can use the Form Primitives to implement custom layouts or controls as necessary.

More details on how to assemble form components in larger form patterns can be found in the [form patterns](https://github.com/patterns/form-patterns) documentation.
