## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Conditionally conformant</Doc::Badge>

Form primitives arenâ€™t conformant until used in conjunction with the other components/elements that will make them conformant.

## Known issues

If a link is used within a label, helper text, or error text, it will not be presented as a link to the user with a screen reader; only the text content is read out. As such, care should be used when considering this feature.
