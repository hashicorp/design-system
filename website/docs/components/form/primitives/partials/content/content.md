## Label

- We recommend keeping labels clear and concise, about 1-3 words. They should not consist of full sentences.
- All inputs need a visible label to let users know what the purpose of the input is. This is required for accessibility by [WCAG 3.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html)

## Helper Text

- Use helper text to give the user extra details about the data you’re asking them to input, e.g., formatting requirements such as MM-DD-YYYY.

## Errors

- Error messages should provide the user with enough context to guide them in resolving the error.
- Keep labels and legends short and to the point (ie. "Select one option")
- Avoid overt politeness; don’t use "please" or "thank you" in your messaging.
- If an input is errored out, it is visually identifiable with associated error messaging by [WCAG 3.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-identification.html).
- If an input is errored out, the messaging needs to be clear for the user to rectify the issue by [WCAG 3.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion.html).
- If the data inputted is related to legal or financial information, the user is given an opportunity to review, confirm or rectify the information before finalizing its submission by [WCAG 3.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data.html)
- Use roles or properties to help identify statuses so that they are accessible by assistive technologies without receiving focus by [WCAG 4.1.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html).
