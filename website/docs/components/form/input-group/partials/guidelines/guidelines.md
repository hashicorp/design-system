## Usage

An Input Group is intentionally published as an agnostic container element that wraps one or more inputs and actions, making the relevant use cases broad.

!!! Info

The way in which these components are published and assembled together is fundamentally different between the Figma and Ember components.

- In Figma, we publish multiple primitive components (`Segmented Button` and `Segmented Input`) that are intended to be assembled in an auto layout container. A pre-assembled `Base` component is also available for more simple instances.
- The Ember component acts as a container to enforce consistent styling and grouping of nested Helios form components. It does not handle any logic or functionality out of the box, this is left up to the nested form elements.

### When to use

- When filtering complex data, searching within a set of filters, and creating complex filtering patterns.
- When collecting information in a way that benefits from a "connected" visual representation, e.g., a key/value pair.
- When an action performs a generative function rather than a submit function, e.g., generating API credentials.
- As a complex data input, e.g., connecting to an external resource.

### When not to use

- To submit a form or set of inputs. An Input Group can exist within a form to collect complex data, but should not submit that data via a form method. Use the guidelines in [Form patterns](/patterns/form-patterns) instead.
- To connect multiple fields that each require their own label.
- When adding a prefix or suffix to an input field. This is not currently supported by Helios form components, instead consider using a simple text element preceeding or following the form element.

## Primitive components

An Input Group can consist of multiple primitive subcomponents that vary in their properties and intended input value. We recommend limiting usage in both Figma and code to those defined in the `Segmented Button` and `Segmented Input` primitives to ensure consistent styling and grouping.

### Segmented Button

- **Default**: a default button can perform a function or interaction within an Input Group, e.g., generating an object, string, or value in a field it is connected to. It is an extension of the Helios [Button](/components/button).
- **Toggle**: a toggle button can be used to filter or narrow the available parameters when searching within a data set or group of objects. This is an extension of the Helios [Toggle Button](/components/dropdown#toggle).

Different types of Segmented Button types within an Input Group will function and impact the UX in different ways, e.g., a `Toggle` can act as a filtering mechanism, while a `Button` can perform a function.

### Segmented Input

A `Segmented Input` is an extension of Helios form components and their variants, including:

- [Text Input](/components/form/text-input)
    - [Text](/components/form/text-input#text)
    - [Password](/components/form/text-input#password)
    - [Search](/components/form/text-input#search)
    - [Date and time](/components/form/text-input#date-and-time)
- [Select](/components/form/select)

Different Segmented Input types can be combined within an Input Group to collect more complex data and support complex filtering patterns. Use the type that makes the most sense for the intended value or data.

### Custom elements

If you need to use a custom component within an Input Group, ensure that the visual language and styling match the primitives, or contact the Design Systems Team for [assistance](/about/support).

## Base component

In Figma, the `Base` component is a combination of a Segmented Button and Segmented Input and is intended for more simple use cases. The properties of each nested primitive are exposed in the component to support rapid customization.

## Examples

Since an Input Group is intended to be agnostic in relation to the inputs and actions it contains, the number of potential use cases and examples are broad. These examples should serve as inspiration for the different scenarios, contexts, and combinations of elements supported by the Input Group guidelines.

### Within a filter pattern

An Input Group can be used in a filter pattern as a means to reduce or limit the returned items in a dataset through the selection of specific parameters and values that are present in the dataset. Multiple Input Groups may be used within a filter pattern depending on the complexity of the dataset.

![Filter pattern example](/assets/components/form/input-group/input-group-example-filter-pattern-01.png)

This example showcases a larger filter pattern that consists of two Input Groups; the first allowing the user to filter what parameters are included in a search query, the second grouping similar filter parameters relationally.

### Within a form

While less common, an Input Group can be used within a form to collect related data, perform generative functions like creating API keys, and for filtering within a search field.

!!! Do

Use an Input Group to perform a generative function within a form.

![Input Group API key example](/assets/components/form/input-group/input-group-example-form-01.png =450x*)
!!!

!!! Do

Use an Input Group to determine the intended method of request or connection.

![Input Group method example](/assets/components/form/input-group/input-group-example-form-02.png =450x*)
!!!

!!! Dont

Don't use an Input Group when fields are related, but aren't stored in the same object upon submission. This example features a payment form with an Input Group and label, but uses a placeholder instead of a label to communicate what information the field collects.

## Content

The content within the Input Group is dependent on the context:

- If used in a form, the Input Group should be used within a [Form::Fieldset](/components/form/primitives) primitive and requires a single label.
- If used within a filtering pattern, no label is required.
