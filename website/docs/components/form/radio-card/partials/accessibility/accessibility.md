!!! Info

**Links within labels, helper text, or error text**

If a link is used within a label, helper text, or error text, it will not be presented as a link to the user with a screen reader; only the text content is read out. We understand avoiding links within help/error text or labels may be impossible, but we recommend using this method sparingly.
