## Spacing

Spacing in forms is based on a decreasing scale on an 8px grid. From largest to smallest, the spacing structure is:

- The Form Header, Sections, Separators, and Footer are 32px apart.
- Stacked inputs are 24px apart.
- Side by side inputs within a Section Multi Field Group are 16px apart.
- Text elements within the Form Header and Form Section Headers are 8px apart.
