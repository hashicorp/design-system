In this page we collect a few "base" elements that are used to build/compose the "form" fields. They can also be used to build custom fields (in very specific cases).

*   `Form::Label` is the label associated with the form control
*   `Form::HelperText` is an optional extra text used to help the user understand what the field is intended for
*   `Form::Error` is the error message shown to the user in case of failed validation of the field
*   `Form::Indicator` is the indicator for "Required" or "Optional" user inputs
*   `Form::Legend` is the legend associated to the fieldset
*   `Form::Field` is the generic container for control, label, helper text and error messaging
*   `Form::Fieldset` is the generic container to group multiple fields with label, helper text and error messaging
