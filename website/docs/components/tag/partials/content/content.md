**Differences between Figma and code**

Tooltip placement can only be customized in the Ember component. For simplicity, the Figma component only includes top placement.

Tags can display about 20 characters maximum before the text becomes automatically truncated. When truncated, the full text will display in a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) that appears when the user hovers or focuses the Tag. This Tooltip displays above the Tag by default; however, the placement can be customized.
