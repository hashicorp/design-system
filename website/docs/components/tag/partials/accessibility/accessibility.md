## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="success">Conformant</Doc::Badge>

When used as recommended, there should not be any accessibility issues with this component.

- A screen reader will read the tags from left to right, ie. "dismiss [text]".
- Link tags and dismissible tags must be standalone elements and should not be nested inside other interactive elements because they cannot be properly accessed by a screen reader.
