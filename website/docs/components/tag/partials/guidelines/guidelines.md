## Usage

### When to use

Use tags to indicate an objectâ€™s categorization, i.e., for filtering.

### When not to use

- For static metadata, status, or to display a new feature, use [Badge](/components/badge).
- For collection enumeration or version number, use [BadgeCount](/components/badge-count).

### Layout

- The tag component can be used in several different layouts, but we commonly see them in a list or a group.
- Tags will fill the parent container and then wrap, as necessary.

#### List

### Spacing

As a best practice, use a vertical spacing of 12px and horizontal spacing of 8px between tags.

When content within the tag is not user-generated, it should be concise and consistent with the category name.
