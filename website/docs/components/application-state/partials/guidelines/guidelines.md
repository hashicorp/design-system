## Usage

### When to use
- When the user needs more information to complete a task, you can use footer actions to guide them to the appropriate location for that information.
- When the user encounters an error or needs to fix a problem, you can use footer actions in the Application State to provide them with appropriate steps to solve the error or obtain access.
### When not to use
An Application State may not be necessary in the following scenarios:
- Simple interfaces
- Single-page applications
- Temporary actions
- Non-linear user flows
