## Usage

### When to use
- When a user's action does not yield any results due to incorrect or incomplete input.
- When an application encounters an issue or error during its operation.

### When not to use
- When the absence of content is expected and does not require an explanation to the user. 
- When there is a clear and intuitive way to add or populate content. 

### Header 
- The icon should be relevant and communicate the same purpose as the errorCode.
- The title should be short to provide a clear and concise message.


### Body 
- Focus on relevant information and avoid unnecessary details.
- Provide a straightforward explanation of the problem or error.
- Suggestions or guidance for how the user can resolve the issue, if possible.

### Footer
- In the footer, you can include two stand-alone links. It's important to avoid replacing these links with call-to-action buttons (CTA) as doing so may cause misalignment with the code.

#### Divider (optional)
Dividers are optional but recommended when dividing content and actions.
