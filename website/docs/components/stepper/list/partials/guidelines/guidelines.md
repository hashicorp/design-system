## Usage

### When to use

- In onboarding, account creation or initial setups that are broken up into multiple steps to more easily segment content.
- To communicate what has and has not been completed in a multi-step flow.
- For progress that does not require a user to remain on a single page to complete.

### When not to use

- When the user needs to remain within the step to complete it, use the [Stepper Nav](/components/stepper/nav).
- For simple forms or when progress doesn't need to be tracked, use structured page content.

## Content

The Stepper List has a title, an optional description, and a generic slot for content.

### Title

Titles provide an overview to help users understand what tasks need to be completed and their purpose within the flow. Titles are required and should be brief.

### Description

Descriptions are optional. They should provide additional context but be brief. We recommend that all steps either have a description or do not.

!!! Do

Ensure description visibility is consistent.

!!!

!!! Dont

Don't mix and match description visibility.

## Progressive disclosure

We recommend showing only the contents of the **in-progress** step. This narrows the focus to the specific step and ensures steps are completed in order. However, this isnâ€™t always possible, and sometimes context from the previous step allows the user to complete the next step. Use your best judgment.

## Using processing status

If data can be submitted within a step, showing the status as `processing` provides the user with immediate feedback.

If an error occurs, that error should be displayed within the step. The steps status will revert to `progress`.
