## Usage

### When to use

- In onboarding, account creation, or initial setups that are broken up into multiple steps.
- To communicate what has and has not been completed in a multi-step flow.
- For progress that does not require the user to remain on the current page to complete.

### When not to use

- When the user needs to remain within the step to complete it, use the [Stepper Nav](/components/stepper/nav).
- For simple forms or when progress doesn't need to be tracked, use structured page content.

## Content

The Stepper List includes a title, an optional description, and a generic slot for content.

### Title

Titles provide an overview to help users understand what tasks need to be completed and their purpose within the flow. Titles are required and should be brief.

### Description

Descriptions are optional. They can be used to provide additional brief context. If used, we recommend providing a description for all steps.

!!! Do

Ensure inclusion of descriptions is consistent.

!!!

!!! Dont

Don't mix and match inclusion of descriptions.

## Progressive disclosure

We recommend showing the contents of the **in-progress** step while hiding the contents of other steps. This narrows the focus to the current step and ensures steps are completed in order. However, context from the previous step is sometimes needed for the user to complete the next step, so use your best judgment.

!!! Do 

Show the contents of one step at a time.

!!!

!!! Dont

Don’t introduce visual noise. Instead, focus the user’s attention on which action should be taken first.

## Using processing status

Set the status as `processing` to provide the user with immediate feedback when data is submitted within a step.

![A Stepper list with two steps. In the first step, the user is pressing a button and the step is in a processing state.](/assets/components/stepper/list/stepper-list-processing-status.png)

If an error occurs, the error should be displayed within the step and the status should remain in `progress`.
