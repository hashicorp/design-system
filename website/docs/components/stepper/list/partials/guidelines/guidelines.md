## Usage

### When to use

- In onboarding, account creation, or initial setups that are broken up into multiple steps.
- To communicate what has and has not been completed in a multi-step flow.
- For progress that does not require a user to remain on the current page to complete.

### When not to use

- When the user needs to remain within the step to complete it, use the [Stepper Nav](/components/stepper/nav).
- For simple forms or when progress doesn't need to be tracked, use structured page content.

## Content

The Stepper List includes a title, an optional description, and a generic slot for content.

### Title

Titles provide an overview to help users understand what tasks need to be completed and their purpose within the flow. Titles are required and should be brief.

### Description

Descriptions are optional. They can be used to provide additional brief context. If used, we recommend providing a description for all steps.

!!! Do

Ensure inclusion of descriptions is consistent.

!!!

!!! Dont

Don't mix and match inclusion of descriptions.

## Progressive disclosure

We recommend showing the contents of only the **in-progress** step while hiding the contents of other steps. This narrows the focus to only the current step and ensures steps are completed in order. However, this isnâ€™t always feasible, and sometimes context from the previous step is needed for the user to complete the next step. Use your best judgment.

## Using processing status

Set the status as `processing` to provide the user with immediate feedback when data is submitted within a step.

If an error occurs, the error should be displayed within the step. The step status should revert to `progress`.
