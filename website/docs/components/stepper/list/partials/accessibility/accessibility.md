## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="success">Conformant</Doc::Badge>

When used as recommended, there should not be any WCAG conformance issues with this component.

## Best Practices

### Using processing status

The `@status` value of "processing" should only be used on a step in relation to a loading or background process or if user interaction is halted until a process completes. Using this status outside these use cases is not conformant.
