The Stepper List includes a title, an optional description, and a generic slot for content.

## Title

Titles provide an overview to help users understand what tasks need to be completed and their purpose within the flow. Titles are required and should be brief.

## Description

Descriptions are optional. They can be used to provide additional brief context. If used, we recommend providing a description for all steps.

!!! Do

Ensure inclusion of descriptions is consistent.
