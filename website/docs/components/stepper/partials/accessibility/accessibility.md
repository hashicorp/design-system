## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Not conformant</Doc::Badge>

The `Stepper Indicator` components are not WCAG-conformant on their own.

## Applicable WCAG Success Criteria

There is no specific WCAG Success Criteria applicable to the stepper indicator on its own. Since we are only providing the stepper indicator and not the entire stepper (at this time), authors are responsible to ensure WCAG conformance is met in any components they build.
