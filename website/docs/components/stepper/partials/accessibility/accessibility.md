## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Not conformant</Doc::Badge>

The Stepper Indicator components are not WCAG-conformant on their own.

## Best practices

For practical accessibility purposes, consider a Stepper (the whole component) a list of items, with each step being a list item.

## Applicable WCAG Success Criteria

There is no specific WCAG Success Criteria applicable to the Stepper Indicator on its own. Since weâ€™re only providing the Stepper Indicator and not the entire stepper, product teams are responsible for ensuring WCAG conformance is met in any components they build.
