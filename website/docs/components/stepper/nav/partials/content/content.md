## General recommendations

The Stepper Nav supports a title and an optional description. Content should be limited to only what is necessary, and long form content should live within the body of the Step.

### Title

Titles provide an overview to help users understand what tasks need to be completed. Titles are required and should be brief.

### Description

Descriptions provide additional context about the step and are optional. We recommend that all steps either have a description or do not.

!!! Do

Use descriptions consistently.

!!! Dont

Don't mix and match inclusion of descriptions.

### Number of steps

We recommend a maximum of 4 steps. If that isn’t possible, be mindful of how the content within the title and description will wrap on smaller screens.
