## Conformance rating

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Not conformant</Doc::Badge>

The Stepper Indicator components are not WCAG-conformant on their own.

## Best practices

For practical accessibility purposes, consider a Stepper (the whole component) a list of items, with each step being a list item.

## Applicable WCAG Success Criteria

There is no specific WCAG Success Criteria applicable to the Stepper Indicator on its own. Since we’re only providing the Stepper Indicator and not the entire stepper, product teams are responsible for ensuring WCAG conformance is met in any components they build.
