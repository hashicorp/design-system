## Usage

### When to use

- To show content as needed while keeping the UI organized and visually manageable.
- To hide long pieces of content with a similar structure.

### When not to use

- To hide basic non-critical information to users. Instead, consider using a [Reveal](/components/reveal).
- To allow users switch between different content within the same context. Instead, consider using [Tabs](/components/tabs).

### Accordion vs Reveal

While similar in functionality and interaction, the Accordion and Reveal are meant to be used in different scenarios and use cases.

#### When to use the Accordion

- You have multiple sections of content that can be expanded or collapsed.

- Each section of content has its own toggle content, giving users the ability to access specific sections.

- Users need to navigate through different sections of content and selectively expand or collapse sections

- There is a sequential or hierarchical relationship between the different sections.

#### When to use the Reveal

- You have a single piece of content that can be expanded to collapsed to reveal additional details or information.

- The content within the toggle is plain text.

- The content within the reveal is relatively short and simple.

- There is no need for multiple independent sections or hierarchical relationship between different sections.

### Usage examples

### Generic content

### Interactive content

Use `containsInteractive` when nesting interactive content in the toggle. This lets users using assistive technology, access and interact with the nested element.

When using this property, it should be applied to all items. Avoid mixing with default toggles.

!!! Warning

Use this variant only when you need to put interactive elements such as a button or a link within the toggle area. Avoid placing complex elements that may compromise the usability and accessibility of the component.

## Content type

!!! Info

The content type property is only relevant within Figma and doesn’t exist as a property in the code.
!!!

The `content` supports any custom content, local components, or Helios components via an `instance swap` property (customInstance) in Figma. In code, `yield` is supported.

### Default
