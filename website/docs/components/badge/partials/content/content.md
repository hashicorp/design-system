## General recommendations

- Labels should be short and to the point (~25 characters). They should not consist of full sentences but should provide enough context to be useful, especially when using status badges.
- Use language consistently within each product. For example, when using “In Progress” for one badge, use that same convention throughout the rest of the application.
- Since Badges are not interactive, they don’t support links. Consider moving the link outside of the Badge instead.
