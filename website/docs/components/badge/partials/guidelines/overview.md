Badges are concise, non-interactive labels that represent metadata.

## Usage

### When to use

- To indicate status, such as “Running”, “Applied”, “Errored”, etc.
- As feature flags, such as “In Preview”, “Beta”, “New”, etc.
- For categorizations, such as Product Lines and Account Levels.
- For keyboard shortcut hints, such as “Esc”.

### When not to use

- To display version numbers or collection counts in Tabs, use [BadgeCount](/components/badge-count/overview)
- For a list of metadata elements (like selected filters), consider using a [Tag](/components/tag/overview).
- For dismissable elements, consider using a [Tag](/components/tag/overview).
- For longer status messages, consider an [Alert](/components/alert/overview).
- Don’t use a link within a Badge, consider moving the link outside of the Badge.
