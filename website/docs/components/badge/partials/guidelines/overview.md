Badges are concise, non-interactive labels that represent metadata. It should be used:

- to indicate status, such as “Running”, “Applied”, “Errored”, etc
- as feature flags, such as “In Preview”, “Beta”, “New”, etc
- for categorizations, such as Product Lines and Account Levels
- for keyboard shortcut hints, such as “Esc”

_Notice: for collection enumeration or version number, use [BadgeCount](/components/badge-count/)._
