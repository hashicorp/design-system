## Usage

### When to use

- To indicate status, such as “Running”, “Applied”, “Errored”, etc.
- As feature flags, such as “In Preview”, “Beta”, “New”, etc.
- For categorizations, such as Product Lines and Account Levels.
- For keyboard shortcut hints, such as `Esc`.

### When not to use

- To display version numbers or collection counts in Tabs, consider [Badge Count](/components/badge-count).
- For a list of metadata elements (like selected filters), consider [Tag](/components/tag).
- For dismissable elements, consider [Tag](/components/tag).
- For longer status messages, consider [Alert](/components/alert).

## Color

There are six colors: `neutral`, `neutral-dark-mode`, `highlight`, `critical`, `success`, and `warning`.

<Hds::Badge @text="Neutral" @color="neutral" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Neutral-dark-mode" @color="neutral-dark-mode" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Highlight" @color="highlight" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Critical" @color="critical" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Success" @color="success" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Warning" @color="warning" />

Use color logically.

- **Neutral** to call attention to general metadata, such as “New”, “Beta”, “In Preview”, etc.
- **Neutral (dark mode)** for general metadata on dark backgrounds, such as sidebars and headers.
- **Highlight** for general metadata that needs a more obvious callout or prominence on the page.
- **Success** to indicate a successful or passive action, such as “Running”.
- **Warning** to indicate a warning.
- **Critical** to indicate critical feedback or something needing immediate action.

### Alternative color usage

Badges can also indicate different account levels: 

<Hds::Badge @color="critical" @type="filled" @icon="award" @text="Bronze" />
<Hds::Badge @color="neutral" @type="filled" @icon="award" @text="Silver" />
<Hds::Badge @color="warning" @type="filled" @icon="award" @text="Gold" />

## Type

There are three types of Badges: `filled`, `inverted`, and `outlined`.

<Hds::Badge @text="Filled" @type="filled" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Inverted" @type="inverted" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Outlined" @type="outlined" />

### Filled

<Hds::Badge @text="Neutral filled" />
<Hds::Badge @color="highlight" @text="Highlight filled" />
<Hds::Badge @color="success" @text="Success filled" />
<Hds::Badge @color="warning" @text="Warning filled" />
<Hds::Badge @color="critical" @text="Critical filled" />

Use filled Badges when displaying many on a single page or for subtle callouts.

For example:

- when listing statuses in a table
- for successful or passive actions

### Inverted

<Hds::Badge @type="inverted" @text="Neutral inverted" />
<Hds::Badge @type="inverted" @color="highlight" @text="Highlight inverted" />
<Hds::Badge @type="inverted" @color="success" @text="Success inverted" />
<Hds::Badge @type="inverted" @color="warning" @text="Warning inverted" />
<Hds::Badge @type="inverted" @color="critical" @text="Critical inverted" />

Use inverted Badges to draw extra attention to something. However, avoid using too many inverted Badges on one page, as it could overwhelm the user and reduce the importance of nearby elements.

For example:

- for errors or other critical feedback that needs addressing

### Outlined

<Hds::Badge @type="outlined" @text="Neutral outlined" />
<Hds::Badge @type="outlined" @color="highlight" @text="Highlight outlined" />
<Hds::Badge @type="outlined" @color="success" @text="Success outlined" />
<Hds::Badge @type="outlined" @color="warning" @text="Warning outlined" />
<Hds::Badge @type="outlined" @color="critical" @text="Critical outlined" />

Use outlined Badges as an alternative to filled Badges, but when extra attention is not required.

## Size

There are three sizes: `small`, `medium`, and `large`. Content within the Badges may truncate as screen sizes reduce.

<Hds::Badge @text="Small" @size="small" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Medium" @size="medium" />
<Hds::Badge @text="Large" @size="large" />

Medium is preferred, but use a badge size that best fits the UI.

For example:

- use large Badges when inline with a heading
- use small or medium Badges in tables, depending on the data density

!!! Insight

**Structure migration tip**

Use small Badges in place of Structure Badges.
!!!

## Icon

Badges come in a few icon and text combinations; text only, icon only, and icon + text (where the icon is in the leading position). Use icons intentionally and only when they provide the user with extra value.

<Hds::Badge @color="neutral" @type="filled" @text="Text only" />
<Hds::Badge @color="neutral" @type="filled" @icon="corner-down-left" @isIconOnly={{true}} @text="Icon only" />
<Hds::Badge @color="neutral" @type="filled" @icon="hexagon" @text="Text + Icon" />

## Content

- Labels should be short and to the point (~25 characters). They should not consist of full sentences but should provide enough context to be useful, especially when using status badges.
- Use language consistently within each product. For example, when using “In Progress” for one badge, use that same convention throughout the rest of the application.
- Since Badges are not interactive, they don’t support links. Consider moving the link outside of the Badge instead.
