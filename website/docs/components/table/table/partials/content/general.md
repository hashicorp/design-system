## General recommendations

While we are not prescriptive about what goes into a cell, there are some best practices to consider:

- We recommended keeping data within a column to one data type. Sorting on multiple data types is technically difficult and makes content reading confusing for assistive technologies.
- While changing the text style/color within a cell is possible, we recommend only using Helios font styles and colors.
