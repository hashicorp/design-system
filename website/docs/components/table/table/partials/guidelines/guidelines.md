## Usage

### When to use

- When comparing, sorting, and filtering multi-dimensional data and objects.
- For data that only requires simple sorting or pagination, and does not require features like nested rows, advanced keyboard navigation, or sticky headers.

### When not to use

- As a layout mechanism. Instead, use [Flex](/layouts/flex) or [Grid](/layouts/grid) layout helpers.
- When data would best be displayed in a scrollable format, with more levels of hierarchy, or when keyboard navigation is needed to achieve usability. Instead, use the [Advanced Table] (components/table/advanced-table)

## Columns

### Sorting

- Sorting is not relevant for all content. Consider when to apply sorting thoughtfully.
- A Table may only be sorted by a single value at a time.

### Tooltips

Labels within the Table column header should be clear, concise, and straightforward. When additional context is necessary, a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) can be used in conjunction with the label. Use tooltips sparingly and as a last resort.

Some common examples where it may be useful to provide additional context in a tooltip include:

- When the label contains a product or HashiCorp-specific term.
- When the label refers to a setting that can be changed elsewhere in the application.

![Tooltips in a Header Column](/assets/components/table/table-tooltip-example.png)

!!! Dont

We recommend against using a tooltip in all or most column labels in a table as this can add unnecessary visual clutter and increase the cognitive load on the user.

![Tooltips in every column in a table](/assets/components/table/table-tooltip-dont.png)
!!!

### Width

Columns use as much room as they need to use to fit their content unless a specific column width has been declared.

### Placement

!!! Info

The column placement property is only relevant in Figma and doesn’t exist as a property in code.
!!!

The column placement property applies visual styling based on where the column is located relative to other columns in the Table.

### Alignment

The alignment of text and content within a Table impacts readability and the speed at which users can effectively parse the information. The chosen alignment method depends on the content within the cell, purpose of the table, and relative position within the table.

!!! Do

Use consistent alignment between the header label and the cell content.

![Table column placement example](/assets/components/table/table-alignment-do.png)
!!!

!!! Dont

![Table column placement example](/assets/components/table/table-alignment-dont.png)
!!!

#### Start alignment

Align content to the start of the cell by default. This ensures readability across different content types, consistency in content of varying lengths, and alignment between the column header label and the content within the cell.

Use start alignment for:

- String and text-based content (unique identifiers or IDs, names and naming conventions, etc).
- Numerical values that do not contain decimals or floating point numbers.
- Numerical values that contain periods or other delimiter characters (IP addresses).
- Nested components that display a string or text value, e.g., a [Badge](/components/badge).

![Start alignment of content within a table](/assets/components/table/start-alignment-example.png)

#### End alignment

End alignment can be used when expressing numerical values with decimals as this aligns the decimal places vertically.

Common examples of end alignment include:

- Financial information and currency amounts.
- Fractional and floating point values represented with decimals.

![End alignment of content within a table](/assets/components/table/end-alignment-example.png)

End alignment can also be used in the last column of a table to:

- Highlight a "more options" function pertaining to the content within a row.
- As a means to visually "bookend" the row with content that is of a similar length, e.g., timestamps, TTL (time-to-live) values, dates.

![End alignment example within a table with a date and more options](/assets/components/table/end-alignment-example-02.png)

!!! Dont

Don’t end align content that is variable in length. This can make the content more difficult to read by forcing an unnatural [reading pattern](/patterns/button-organization?tab=research#layout-and-reading-patterns).

![End alignment with content that is variable in length](/assets/components/table/end-alignment-variable-length.png)

!!!

#### Other alignment methods

We don’t recommend center or justified alignment of content within a cell or table. These alignment methods can result in the content being difficult to read, especially if it is variable in length.

!!! Dont

Don’t center header labels or cell content within a table.

![Example of centered content within a table](/assets/components/table/center-justified-alignment.png)

## Rows

### Striping

While striping is not required, we recommend it for the added usability benefits.

When using striping in a Table, start with the second row to allow the Table Header to be further differentiated from the the row directly beneath it.

![Table striping examples](/assets/components/table/table-striping.png)

#### Benefits of striping

!!! Warning

**Accessibility alert**

Striped rows use a subtle background color to differentiate from non-striped rows. Confirm that nested components within striped rows continue to meet contrast accessibility criteria.
!!!

While striping is not required, we recommend it for the added usability benefits.

- Striping makes data within the Table easier to read by increasing differentiation between rows.
- Striping increases scannability, especially for large datasets that result in many rows.
- Striping increases legibility when the type of data is similar between columns; e.g., columns that catalog mostly text or numerical data benefit from more differentiation between rows.

When using striping in a Table, the first tinted row will be the second row of the table. This allows the Table Header to be further differentiated from the row directly beneath it.

![Table striping examples](/assets/components/table/table-striping.png)


### Placement

!!! Info

The row placement property is only relevant in Figma and doesn’t exist as a property in code.
!!!

Row placement determines the visual styling based on where the row is placed relative to other rows within the Table. Only cells with a column placement that is either `start` or `end` utilize the row placement property; column position `middle` does not utilize this property.

![Table row placement example](/assets/components/table/table-row-placement.png)

## Headers

- Headers should be clear, concise, and straightforward.
- The text should be descriptive of the type of content contained within the cell, e.g. Created date, Email, Project name.
- Headers should use sentence-case capitalization, not all-caps.

## Cells

Cells are the core organizational container within a Table. In order for the user to be able to sort and read the table easily, each cell in a table should contain one piece of data. Having more than one piece of information inside a cell also makes it harder for users to navigate the relationships between headers and content. 

### Density

- We recommend using `medium` cell density by default.
- If content is complex or a smaller data set (e.g., a Table of basic user data), `tall` cell density allows for more breathing room surrounding the content.
- If content is largely string/text-based, `short` allows for more content to be displayed within the page.
- While denser content allows for more rows to be displayed within a single page, it also makes comprehension and scanning more difficult.

![Table cell density](/assets/components/table/table-density.png)

## Horizontal scrolling
Use horizontal scrolling when columns in a Table need to expand beyond the standard Table container. We recommend only implementing horizontal scrolling when data becomes difficult to read in a single view. Use the [Advanced Table](components/table/advanced-table), when keyboard navigation and sticky columns ease the reading experience for large data-sets.

For more information on the types of approaches used to implement horizontal scrolling, refer to the [code tab](/components/table/table?tab=code#scrollable-table)

## Multi-select

!!! Info

For more details around using a multi-select Table, recommended patterns, and intended interactions visit the [Multi-select patterns](/patterns/table-multi-select) documentation.
!!!

A multi-select table includes checkboxes enabling users to select multiple rows in a table to perform bulk operations. Checking or unchecking the checkbox in the table header either selects or deselects the checkboxes on each row in the table body. Individual checkboxes in the rows can also be selected or deselected.

A multi-select consists of: 

1. A select all in a table is used in the table's header row. This acts as the parent checkbox, allowing the selection or deselection of all child rows in a single table simultaneously.

![Example of multi-select in a table header](/assets/components/table/multi-select-header.png)

2. Row level select is used in each table row allowing for the selection of an individual row.

![Example of multi-select within table cells](/assets/components/table/multi-select-cells.png)

### Intended interaction

!!! Info

This documentation currently covers only fundamental multi-select table interactions. We're working to include more comprehensive patterns for handling actions when multiple rows are selected and how this impacts filtering and pagination within a data set. For questions or concerns, please reach out to [#team-design-systems](https://hashicorp.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C7KTUHNUS)
!!!

- When individual rows are selected, the parent checkbox in the Table header changes to display an indeterminate state. 
- When no or some rows (but not all) are selected in a single Table, clicking the parent checkbox in the Table header will change to display as checked and all rows on that page will be selected.
- When all rows are selected in a single Table, the parent checkbox in the header appears as checked. Clicking the parent checkbox will deselect all rows on that page.
- An additional action outside of the Table is needed in order to select all rows across a paginated Table.
