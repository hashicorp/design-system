## Column resizing

The Advanced Table supports resizing individual columns to display the entire contents of a cell.

This is supported via an interactive "resize border" that functions either by clicking and dragging on the horizontal axis with a mouse or by moving the focus to the resize border with the keyboard and using the right and left arrow keys.

The Figma component does not support this resizing feature. Instead, we publish a [Resize Border](https://www.figma.com/design/iweq3r2Pi8xiJfD9e6lOhF/HDS-Components-v2.0?m=auto&node-id=80647-127234&t=UHpPyO7erZKLy4SD-1) component and [Templates](https://www.figma.com/design/iweq3r2Pi8xiJfD9e6lOhF/HDS-Components-v2.0?m=auto&node-id=72039-5091&t=UHpPyO7erZKLy4SD-1) to use as a starting point for expressing this interaction.

### Minimum and maximum width

To prevent a column from being resized beyond a reasonable amount, the Advanced Table enforces a default minimum and maximum width of `150px` and `800px`, respectively. These can be overridden via the [component API](/components/table/advanced-table?tab=code#advancedtable), if necessary.
