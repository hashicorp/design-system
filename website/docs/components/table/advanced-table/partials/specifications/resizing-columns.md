## Column resizing

The Advanced Table supports resizing individual columns to display the entire contents of a cell or to give hierarchical preference to other columns within the table.

The Ember component supports this via a "resize border" interactive element which functions either by clicking and dragging on the horizontal axis with a mouse, or by moving focus to the resize border with a keyboard and using the right and left arrow keys.

The Figma component does not support a specific property to communicate resizing. Instead, we publish a [Resize Border](#jory-to-update-this-link-when-figma-is-published) component individually for use in prototypes or interactive demonstrations. [Templates](#jory-to-update-this-link-when-figma-is-published) are available on the Advanced Table stickersheet to provide a starting point for expressing this type of interaction.

To do:

- Include images
- Content about min/max
