The `Table` component itself is where most of options will be applied. Use of the component API (below) will automatically render sortable columns if desired.

Additionally, there are child components that can also be used to provide custom options.

*   The `Hds::Table::Tr` component is a template-only component. It supports `...attributes` but is not eligible to receive interactions. It can contain `Hds::Table::Th` or `Hds::Table::Td` components.
*   The `Hds::Table::Th` component is a template-only component. It supports `...attributes` but is not eligible to receive interactions itself, although it can contain interactive elements. However, it is not likely that you will need to add interactive elements to this component as the sorting is already otherwise provided for.
*   The `Hds::Table::Td` component is a template-only component. It supports `...attributes` but is not eligible to receive interactions itself; however it can contain interactive elements.
