The `Hds::Table` component should be used for displaying tabular data; it renders an [HTML table element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table).

This component takes advantage of the `sort-by` helper provided in [ember-composable-helpers](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers). While some of the examples provided on this page use some of the other helpers provided in this addon, they are not required to use the design system. Read the [configuration information](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers#configuration) provided by the addon if you wish to customize which helpers are included in your own app.
