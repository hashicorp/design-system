## Icon usage

Icons used within cells can help differentiate content, highlight additional metadata, increase the hierarchy of a value, or otherwise _enhance_ the text or value it is paired with. Use the outlined icon style by default and if contrast against other icons is important, use the filled style.

!!! Dont

Don’t use an icon as the sole communication method within a cell, even if the icon is explicit, e.g., a brand or service icon.

!!! Dont

We don’t recommend using an icon to indicate the status of an object, row, or resource. Instead, consider using a [Badge](components/badge).

### Service icons

Use service icons within a cell to communicate the source or provider of a service.

### Grouping

Use icons to communicate commonalities between values or that a value is part of a larger object or hierarchical structure.

### Product branding

Use icons to communicate that a specific item is a HashiCorp product or resource.

!!! Dont

Don’t use an [Icon Tile](/assets/components/icon-tile) in place of an icon within a table cell.

### Leading vs. trailing icons

In general, we recommend using **leading icons** because the text following the icon will remain aligned and thus be easier for the user to scan.

Don’t mix and match different icon positions in the same column.
