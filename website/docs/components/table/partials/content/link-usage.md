## Links within cells

!!! Info

This guidance is an extension of the [Inline Link](/components/link/inline) guidelines.
!!!

Within a table, use `secondary` (`Foreground / Strong`) links as the default.

Use `Body / 200 / Link` as the default typographic style within a table. This style increases the prominence a small amount to differentiate it from other string and non-interactive content.

#### Multiple links

If a table contains more than one column of links, consider using `Body / 200 / Link` for the most important link; usually the title of the row, ID, or other naming convention. For less important links use `Body / 200 / Regular` with an added underline in Figma.

#### Long-form content

If a cell contains long-form or descriptive content, use the link style that is most appropriate for the hierarchy and frequency of links within the content. If there are a minimal number of links, `primary` styling may be appropriate, but if there are many links `secondary` styling may be more appropriate.
