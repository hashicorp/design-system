When used as recommended, there should not be any WCAG conformance issues with this component.

## Focus in Tables

- Focus will only move through sortable headers and will skip over non-sortable headers as they arenâ€˜t interactive. 
- Interactive elements within cells will receive focus, but entire cells and entire rows will not.

## Best practices

### Tooltips in headers

Since columns within the table header can control sorting within the table, the header column is not eligible to receive additional interactive elements such as tooltip/toggletip or other components that rely on interactivity to display content (nested interactive elements).

If you need a tooltip, there may not be enough contextual information about the table or the label within the header may not be clear enough.

!!!

### Interactive rows

The table row element (`tr`) is not eligible to receive interactions. That is, actions cannot be attached to a table row. If an interactive element is desired, place it within a table cell element (`td`) within that row (i.e., `<td><a href="somelink.html">Some link</a></td>`).

### For engineers

When providing additional or alternative styles to the table element, do not change the `display` property in the CSS. This alters how the table is presented to the user with assistive technology; they will no longer be presented with a table.
