## Best practices

### Keyboard navigation

In most cases, the numbered pagination provides a greater user experience. It allows users to jump between pages and always return to the first page or go to the last page without navigating through the pages manually.

If your product only has cursor pagination, it wonâ€™t be able to support the numbered variant. Only applications with offset pagination can implement the numbered pagination variant.

Focus and move between pagination controls.
