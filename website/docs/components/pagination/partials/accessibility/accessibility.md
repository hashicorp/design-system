## Conformance rating

<!-- Update conformance rating badge with correct status and remove the others -->
<Doc::Badge @type="success">Conformant</Doc::Badge>

When used as recommended, there should not be any WCAG conformance issues with this component.

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Conditionally conformant</Doc::Badge>

Explain how the component is conditionally conformant. For example, any component that offers text truncation is conditionally conformant- it is conformant as long as the text truncation feature is not used.

<Doc::Badge @type="critical">Not conformant</Doc::Badge>

The `Component Name` component is not WCAG-conformant on its own. (Explain how to use it in a conformant way)

## Best practices

### Keyboard navigation

In most cases, the numbered pagination provides a greater user experience. It allows users to jump between pages and always return to the first page or go to the last page without navigating through the pages manually.

If your product only has cursor pagination, it wonâ€™t be able to support the numbered variant. Only applications with offset pagination can implement the numbered pagination variant.

Focus and move between pagination controls.

`tab`

Trigger button to navigate to another page.

`enter`
