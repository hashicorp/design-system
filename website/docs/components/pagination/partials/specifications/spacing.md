## Spacing

- When using the pagination bar, the container should be flush on the left & right with the content.
- When using the pagination, the component should be center aligned with the content it relates to.
- Make sure there’s enough distance and breathing room between the pagination and unrelated content (e.g. another section below it), so it’s clear what content the pagination is paired with.

When pairing the pagination or pagination bar with your content, we recommend leaving 16px of margin between the pagination and the content it relates to.

If your product uses a significantly higher or lower spacing scale, increase or decrease the spacing accordingly.
