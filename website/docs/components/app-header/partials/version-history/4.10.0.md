## 4.10.0

### Updated

- Changed default value of `a11yRefocusSkipTo` from "#main" to "#hds-main"
- Hid the closed menu content in mobile view using CSS instead of conditionally rendering/not rendering the menu content.
- Added `NavigationNarrator` with associated arguments to provide a "skip link".
- Styled inoperable actions as disabled (which occurs when the `SideNav` is expanded in mobile view)
- Fixed styling issue to prevent `Button` and `Dropdown` nested within another `Dropdown` from inheriting dark theme.
- Fixed issue with mobile menu to prevent tabbing to hidden content and hiding it from assistive technology when closed.
