## Color

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="neutral" @icon="dashboard" />
</section>

Use **Neutral** if the object or page is not a feature of a specific product, but is something universal.

For example:

- For a 'Dashboard' or 'User' page

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="consul" @icon="server-cluster" />
</section>

Use a **product-specific color** for objects or pages that are directly related to a product.

For example:

- For a page showing a 'Consul cluster'
- In a card or table row that represents a 'Consul cluster'

Medium is the default size, but use the size that best fits any supporting text or UI.

For example:

- Don't use large IconTiles in tables

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="neutral" @icon="dashboard" @size="large" />
</section>

Large

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="neutral" @icon="dashboard" @size="medium" />

## Secondary icon

A secondary icon can be added to provide additional context.

For example:

- For an 'Add user' pag,e the 'plus' icon indicates the action.

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="neutral" @icon="user" @size="large" @iconSecondary="plus"/>
</section>

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="neutral" @icon="user" @size="medium" @iconSecondary="plus"/>
</section>

<section>
  <Hds::IconTile @color="neutral" @icon="user" @size="small" @iconSecondary="plus"/>
</section>

## Using with content

IconTiles should not appear without accompanying content. They should be presented alongside a text label for the object or page they are being used to represent. Think of them as an accessory.

---

## Accessibility

IconTiles should be hidden from screen readers.
