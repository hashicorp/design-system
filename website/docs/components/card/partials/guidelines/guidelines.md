## Usage

### When to use

Use a card container to help build more consistently styled cards.

## Types

### Static cards

Static cards may contain interactive elements but must not be actionable or interactive on their own. They should not have any shadows applied to them, so that they can be differentiated from an interactive card.

### Interactive cards

Interactive cards are actionable, e.g., they can be hovered over, clicked, or focused on. 

!!! Dont

If you're using an interactive element (like an `<a>` or `<button>`) as the main content wrapper inside `Card::Container`, avoid placing other interactive elements inside it. This kind of nesting creates accessibility issues—particularly for screen reader users—because nested interactive elements can't be reliably accessed or operated.

!!! Do

When the card is interactive, only static elements should be contained within it.
