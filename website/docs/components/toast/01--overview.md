# Toast component - Overview

A Toast is an element intended for **messages that are the result of a user's actions**.

For system-generated messages see the [Alert](/components/alert/01_overview/) component.

Typically it displays a brief, temporary notification and it disappears on its own (after a time interval) or as a result of a user interacting with it.

It can have an **icon** (optional), a **title** and/or **description** (required to have at least one of the two), some **actions** (optional) and a **dismiss/close** button.

🚨 _**Important**: we provide only the visual styling to this element, so other features like placement, animations/transitions, and what happens on dismiss, will need to be implemented in your app (eg. with an Ember addon)._
