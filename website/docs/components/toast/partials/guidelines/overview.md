Toasts deliver messages resulting from a user's actions. They typically disappear after a set interval or upon user dismissal, offering a non-intrusive way to provide feedback. While [Alerts](/components/alert) handle system-generated messages or critical information, Toasts suit less urgent feedback, such as indicating a user-initiated process's success or ongoing status.
