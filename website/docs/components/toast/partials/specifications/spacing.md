## Spacing

Toasts appear in the bottom right corner of the viewport with a margin of 32px from the bottom and 24px from the right side of the viewport. If a warning or error is contextual to a specific UI feature, such as a form, directly associate an Alert to that feature instead of using a Toast.

### Displaying multiple Toasts

When displaying multiple Toasts, they should stack vertically with a 16px margin between each Toast. For consistency, each stacked Toast should be the same width.
