## Conformance status

<Doc::Badge @type="warning">Conditionally conformant</Doc::Badge>

Breadcrumbs are conformant unless using the truncation feature, which would not pass a WCAG conformance audit.

## Known issues

When the browser zoom is scaled to 400% and a truncated menu is open, the menu may extend beyond the viewport and require the user to scroll in multiple directions. This is a failure of [Reflow – 1.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html).

When the browser zoom is scaled to 400% and `@itemsCanWrap` is set to `false`, the text may truncate and become unavailable to keyboard-only users.
