The Filter Bar is used to display and apply filters to a data set. It is most often used in conjunction with the [Advanced Table](/components/table/advanced-table), but is flexible enough to support different renderings of data sets such as in a list or grid of cards.

## Usage

### When to use

- When displaying relevant filters and filters that have been applied to a data set.
- For common filter methods like multi-selection, single selection, numbers, dates, and times.

### When not to use

- for complex query builder features.

## Overlap with the Filter pattern guidance <!--Consider a different headline -->

The Filter Bar component is a successor to the [Filter pattern](/patterns/filter-patterns) documentation and supports the vast majority of filtering experiences within HashiCorp applications. New experiences should use the Filter Bar by default instead of the adhering to the pattern guidance, while already delivered features should consider migrating to the Filter Bar component.

!!! Callout

While the Filter Bar underwent rigorous research and testing, this component is relatively complex compared other Components in the the HDS library. If specific funcionality or filtering methods don't meet your needs, please [contact the Design Systems Team](/about/support) so we can provide support.
