## Core concepts

### Identifier, conditional, and value

Filtering a dataset requires the presence of three paramaters; an **identifier**, a **conditional**, and a value.

- **Identifier** refers to the specific property or category that is being filtered on.
- **Conditional** refers to the relationship between the identifier and the value.
- **Value** refers to the specific value, amount, or metadata attribute being included in the filter.

The combination of these results in a **criteria**. **Add more here**
