## Filter concepts and terminology

### Parameter

**Parameter** refers to the specific property or category that is being filtered on and is often represented by the specific label of the filter.

### Conditional

**Conditional** refers to the relationship between the identifier and the value. When filter on a specific string value most filters use an **equals** (`=`) conditional, while identifiers with numerical values may use **less than/greater than** (`<`/`>`) or a range between two numerical values.

Which conditional to use depends on the type of identifier and the values it contains.
