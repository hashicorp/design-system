Filtering is used to limit the items or objects in a dataset based on one or more user-defined parameters. Filtering is commonly used in tandem with a [Table](/components/table) but has a wide range of relevant use-cases depending on the dataset and context within the application.

When faced with a large dataset, filtering can help the user find a specific item or array of items through progressive reduction; limiting the number of items displayed to the user based on user-defined parameters.
