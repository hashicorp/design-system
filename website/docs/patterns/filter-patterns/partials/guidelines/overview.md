!!! Insight

In version [6.0.0](/whats-new/release-notes#600), the [Filter Bar](/components/filter-bar) component was released to directly support filtering alongside HDS components.

While this documentation is still relevant for filtering experiences (in fact, much of the Filter Bar was based on this guidance), new filtering features should use the Filter Bar component, and already-delivered features should consider migrating to it to ensure consistency moving forward.

Filtering is used to limit the objects in a data set based on one or more parameters. It is commonly used in tandem with a [Table](/components/table/table) or [Advanced Table](/components/table/advanced-table), but the core concepts have a wide range of relevant use cases depending on the type of data set and the context within the application.
