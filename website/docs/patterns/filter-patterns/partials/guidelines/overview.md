!!! Insight

In version [5.2.0](/whats-new/release-notes#520) the [Filter Bar](/components/filter-bar) component was released to support direct filtering with HDS components. While this documentation is still relevant for filtering experiences that have been built around this guidance, new filtering features and experiences should use the Filter Bar component instead, while already delivered features should consider migrating.

Filtering is used to limit the objects in a data set based on one or more parameters. It is commonly used in tandem with a [Table](/components/table/table) or [Advanced Table](/components/table/advanced-table), but the core concepts have a wide range of relevant use cases depending on the type of data set and the context within the application.
