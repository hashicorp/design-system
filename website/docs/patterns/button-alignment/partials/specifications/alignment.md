## Alignment

Alignment refers to how buttons and actions are aligned relative to the container or page they are used in. When combined with different reading patterns and hierarchy focal points, different alignment methods impact the readability, usability, and intended outcome of a function.

- **Left (start) alignment:** align actions to the left of the container or page.
- **Right (end) alignment:**  align actions to the right of the container or page.
- **Center alignment:** center actions in the middle of the container or page.

!!! Info

When considering internationalization (i18n), **start** and **end** are suitable substitutes for **left** and **right** alignment to account for languages that are read right-to-left ([RTL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTL)).

!!! Do

In most scenarios, align buttons to the **left side** of a container or page.

- This reinforces natural reading patterns and a conversational "dialog-like" messaging strategy.
- When combined with a consistent ordering method, the primary button is prioritized in the reading direction.
- When considering different contexts, opting for a single method helps to create consistency between constrained and unconstrained components and patterns.
