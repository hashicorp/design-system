The Helios Table [selection components](/components/table#multi-select) support the selection of one or more results within a Table (multi-select), thus adding support for performing bulk actions and edits on multiple results simultaneously. While we donâ€™t publish a specific component to support this functionality, it can be accomplished by composing multiple Helios components together into a Selection pattern.

This type of functionality can assist the user in editing the same parameter across multiple results or creating more specific, customized views within a Table.

!!! Info

These guidelines are intended to be used as a starting point for a multi-select pattern, but do not cover all scenarios. For more complex data sets and Table instances work to maintain the same level of communication to the user, but using the exact pattern structure and components may not be feasible.
