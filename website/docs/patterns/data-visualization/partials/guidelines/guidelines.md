## Deciding how best to represent data
<!--

Consider first whether a data visualization is actually appropriate for the type of data you wish to present. Oftentimes, just using a table may be clearer or more appropriate.

## Carbon charts components

  TODO: This section links to examples in code. It should be rewritten to instead focus more on design aspects with appropriate illustrations & links added.

IBMâ€™s Carbon Design System includes various [chart components](https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/chart-types/) that we recommend using as a basis for creating visualizations.

### Commonly used chart examples

* [Vertical bar chart](https://charts.carbondesignsystem.com/bar#vertical)
* [Proportional Meter]( https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/simple-charts/#meter-(proportional) )
* [Donut chart](https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/simple-charts/#donut)

## Color palettes

When creating data visualizations, care should be taken to use colors geared towards the type of data being presented. Color choice can also impact meaning.

**There are three main types of color palettes used for data visualization:**

1. Categorical palettes
2. Sequential palettes
3. Diverging palettes

### Categorical palettes

Use for presenting data that has no intrinsic order, such as in a pie or donut chart. Also used for multi-line charts, area charts, stacked or grouped bar charts, etc.

<!-- **Categorical palettes should:**

* Use distinct colors limited to a max of 10.
* Be distinguished primarily by hue. (a11y tip: also use patterns, symbols, or text.)
* Avoid problematic color pairs (e.g., red-green, an issue with color blindness). -->

### Sequential palettes

Use for quantitative or ordered values in a continuum. Useful for heat maps and grouped horizontal bar charts comparing sequential groups such as age ranges, etc.

<!-- **Sequential palettes should:**

- Graduate lightness or hue. (e.g., light blue to dark blue, blue to yellow)
- Ensure sufficient contrast between color values for clear distinction. -->

A graduated color sequence can also distinguish elements in visualizations without inherent axes or directions, such as maps or geographic representations.

### Diverging palettes

Use for presenting two sequences of ordered values with a shared central value. Can be used for diverging bar charts, horizon charts, heat maps, etc.

<!-- **Diverging palettes should:**

- Vary lightness to create two graduated color sequences.
- Contrast the two color sequences by using different hues.
- Use lighter values for colors converging towards the center. -->
