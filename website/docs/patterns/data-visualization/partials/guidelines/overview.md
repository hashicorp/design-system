!!! Info

We encourage the use of [Carbon Charts](https://charts.carbondesignsystem.com/introduction) for all data visualizations. Access the [HashiCorp duplicate of the Carbon Charts Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/k34tT4poC2p1RBQxVwZhW5/-Alpha--Carbon-Charts-Library-Kit-%E2%80%93-Carbon-Design-System--Copy-?node-id=3984-105570&t=YIZdjDNDhgDMtXBd-1) the way you would any other HDS library. Once our Figma instance is merged into IBM, we can connect directly to their library instead.

If you have concerns or questions when using the Carbon Chart library, please send them via the IBM Slack channel [#carbon-charts-design](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C01DTUSCQAJ) and/or [#carbon-charts](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CCA7L4MS9)
