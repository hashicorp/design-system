We recommend using Carbon Design System's [Carbon Charts](https://charts.carbondesignsystem.com/introduction) for data visualizations in HashiCorp products. 

We've imported the latest [Carbon Charts Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/k34tT4poC2p1RBQxVwZhW5/-Alpha--Carbon-Charts-Library-Kit-%E2%80%93-Carbon-Design-System--Copy-?node-id=3984-105570&t=YIZdjDNDhgDMtXBd-1) into the HashiCorp Figma instance. To use these components in Figma, enable the library as you would any other HDS library. 

To get support when using the Carbon Chart library, please message the Carbon Core team in the IBM Slack channel [#carbon-charts-design](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C01DTUSCQAJ) or [#carbon-charts](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CCA7L4MS9).
