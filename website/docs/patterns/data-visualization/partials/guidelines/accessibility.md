## Accessiblity considerations

Do not rely upon color as the sole means for conveying information in charts (or in general). To make charts accessible, combine color with another means of distinction. This could be the use of patterns or symbols combined with or instead of colors. Lightness vs. darkness can also serve as a secondary distinction; however, the visual difference between shades must be large enough to be clearly perceived. You can also add text, such as labels or descriptions of the visual information in the chart.

Adding a thin separating line between adjacent colors, such as a one-pixel white border is helpful to visually distinguish areas but should be combined with at least one of the above recommendations.

### Accessible chart examples

Clearly labeling elements within a chart or graph is very explicit and can enhance the experience for all users.

Using symbols to differentiate between elements removes the reliance on color alone.

Incorporating patterns with color further differentiates elements.
