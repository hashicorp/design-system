## Accessiblity considerations

Do not rely upon color as the sole means for conveying information in charts (or in general). To make charts accessible, combine the use of color with another means of distinction. This could be use of patterns or symbols combined with or instead of colors. Lightness vs. darkness can also serve as a secondary distinction. However, the visual difference between shades must be large enough to clearly perceive. You can also add text such as labels or descriptions of the visual information in the chart.

Clearly labeling elements within a chart or graph is very explicit and can enhance the experience for all users.

Using symbols to differentiate between elements removes the reliance on color alone.

Incorporating patterns with color further differentiates elements.
