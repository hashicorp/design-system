## Accessibility considerations

### Text equivalents for visual information

Provide accessible text for visual data representations.

### Color usage

Donâ€™t rely on color as the sole means for conveying information. To make charts accessible, combine with another means of distinction such as patterns or symbols. Lightness vs. darkness can serve as a yet another distinction. You can also add text, such as labels or descriptions of the visual information in the chart.

A thin separating line between adjacent colors, such as a one-pixel white border is helpful to visually distinguish areas but should be combined with at least one of the above recommendations.

#### Accessible chart examples

Clearly labeling elements can enhance the experience for all users.

Using symbols as a differentiator removes reliance on color alone.

Incorporating patterns with color further differentiates elements.
