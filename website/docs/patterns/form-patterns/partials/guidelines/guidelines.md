## Spacing

Spacing between sections, fields, text, and other form elements should follow a decreasing scale on an 8px grid. This creates a consistent visual hierarchy between elements.

### Sections

A section occupies the largest hierarchy within the form. Sections organize text and fields (inputs, checkboxes, toggles, etc.) into logical groups. A form consisting of more than one section should use a 32px gap between sections.

![Example of multiple sections in a form](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/form-sections.png =450x*)

### Fields

A **field** describes a form control and label pairing. When displaying multiple fields within a section, there should be a 24px gap between each field.

![Example of multiple fields in a section](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/section-fields.png =450x*)

<!-- TODO
Fields can be further divided into two types: **text fields** and **data fields**.

#### Text fields
| Form control | Usage | Examples |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| [Text input](/components/form/text-input) | lorem ipsum | Name, email, password, string and numerical data |
| [Textarea](/components/form/textrea) | Lorem ipsum | Messages, longer-form content |
-->

<!-- TODO
#### Data fields
| Form control | Usage | Examples |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| [Checkbox](/components/form/checkbox) | Lorem ipsum | Lorem ipsum |
| [Radio](/components/form/radio) | Lorem ipsum | Lorem ipsum |
| [Radio Card](/components/form/radio-card) | Lorem ipsum | Lorem ipsum |
| [Select](/components/form/select) | Lorem ipsum | Lorem ipsum |
| [Toggle](/components/form/toggle) | Lorem ipsum | Lorem ipsum |
-->

### Field group

If fields are collecting related information or information that is part of the same object, they may be organized in a field group. Field groups are organized in rows with a 16px gap between fields.

![Example of fields organized in a set](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/field-set.png =450x*)

Common sets of field groups can include:

- Credit card information: card number, expiration date, security code
- Multi-line address field
- First and last name

#### Alignment

Fields organized in a horizontal field group should be aligned to the baseline of each element to account for fields with helper text.

![Baseline alignment within a set](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/baseline-alignment.png =500x*)

### Button Sets

Organize buttons based on the [Button Set](/components/button-set) guidelines, e.g., using a 16px horizontal gap between buttons. For more specifications and examples, refer to the documentation for [button organization](/patterns/button-organization).

![Button set](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/button-set.png =500x*)

## Layout

### Single-column

We recommend using a single-column layout for forms to streamline data entry. Forms across our products should use a maximum width which can be achieved by using the [Form Layout component](/components/form/layout) or by using a size or unit relative to the page, viewport, or container size, e.g., viewport width unit (`vw`), percentage width (`50%`), or a character unit (`ch`).

### Multi-column

While forms should typically follow a [single column layout](/components/form/layout#single-column-layout), you can use the [Section Multi Field Group](/components/form/layout#form-section-multi-field-group) to place multiple fields in a row, as needed.

!!! Do

Use a consistent number of columns throughout the form.

![Consistent number of columns](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/multi-column-consistent-columns.png =500x*)
!!!

!!! Dont

Don't organize a set of fields in two columns and another set in three columns.

![Inconsistent number of columns](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/multi-column-inconsistent-columns.png =500x*)
!!!

!!! Dont

Don't exceed more than three fields in a field group. In most scenarios, it's best to limit the number of columns in a form or section to two.

![Three field maximum in a set](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/multi-column-three-fields-max.png =500x*)
!!!

!!! Do

If using multiple inputs in a row, stack fields vertically at the `md` breakpoint. This behavior is automatically applied in the Form Layout.

![Stack fields](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/multi-column-stacking.png)
!!!

## Width

The width of a form and the fields it contains are largely dependent on the form’s context. Adhering to these high-level guidelines can make a complex form approachable and introduce consistency in the UX application.

### Field width

Generally, a field’s width should account for the estimated width of the content it accepts. This gives the user an accurate sense of the character length and type of content the field accepts, which is important in setting user expectations.

### Responsive properties

As the viewport shrinks, the form should expand relative to the viewport width, eventually occupying the entire width of the content area. Field groups should stack vertically as the viewport shrinks.

## Form headers

In sections consisting of multiple blocks of text, use an 8px vertical gap between elements.

![Example of a text section](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/text-section.png =600x*)

Text elements within a form should use logical sizing to reinforce hierarchy within sections and the form itself. While specifics regarding type hierarchy should be determined at the application level, the Form Layout component establishes a default heading style for form-level and section-level text as a starting point.

## Form organization

### Need-based organization

Fields within a form generally fall into three need-based categories that can determine the order and organization of within a form: **technical and application needs**, **user needs**, and **business needs**.

#### Technical and application needs

Sometimes the values or options for a given field depend on information or selection from a previous field.

Generally, fields that are dependencies for other fields benefit from being organized closer to the start of a form. For example, selecting a cluster tier reveals options for cluster sizes that are only available for the previously selected tier.

![Dependencies within forms example](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/cluster-tier-size-options.png)

#### User needs

Users benefit from logical organization and progressive organization, organizing fields from easiest to hardest.

This can help increase form completion by:

- giving the user a sense of accomplishment early on through “quick wins”
- reducing the probability of the user abandoning a form when they’ve already completed the “easier” segments.

#### Business needs

Organizing fields based on their importance (high to low) to completing the form can help minimize abandonment, a crucial aspect of meeting business goals and metrics.

### Logical organization

Organize fields logically; consider how users fill in information based on the context.

For example, when filling out a payment form, organize the fields in the same order as they appear on a credit card or payment method: name, card number, expiration date, security code.

### Visual organization

Once a logical organization has been established,

- categorize elements and fields into sections,
- introduce typographic elements to establish hierarchy,
- and, if necessary, [use separators](#using-separators) to differentiate sections clearly.

Each one of these methods will help the user better parse and understand the relationships between each section and the fields contained within.

## Form complexity

Since longer forms can result in a lower completion rate, we recommend looking for ways to reduce the overall number of fields whenever possible.

!!! Insight

If a field is optional, consider whether it’s actually needed in the form. If the information isn’t critical to the experience or feature, can the field be removed?
!!!

### Multiple sections

Using sections based on the relationship between fields can make a longer form seem less complex. Introducing typographic elements and dividers can further aid the hierarchy of the form and differentiate sections from one another.

#### Using separators

[Separators](components/separator) introduce more visual hierarchy and differentiation in longer, complex forms.

Use separators to break up different types of content and categories within a form. Only use separators between sections, not between fields.

!!! Dont

Don’t use separators at the end of the last section between the fields and the button set or actions.

![Spacing using separators](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/divider-spacing-dont.png =500x*)
!!!

!!! Do

Instead, use the section spacing value of 32px.

![Spacing between trailing actions](/assets/patterns/form-patterns/divider-spacing-do.png)
!!!

#### Multiple steps or pages

Consider breaking the form into multiple steps or pages for exceedingly long and complex forms (e.g., creating a cluster). For multi-step forms, use a [Stepper](/components/stepper) to indicate status and the user’s location within the form.

## Required and optional

For complex forms, indicate **required** fields. This is the most explicit and transparent method for indicating input needs to users.

For shorter, simpler forms, indicate **optional** fields instead.

Don't mix required and optional labels, stick to one or the other. Using one method can imply that fields without a label are the inverse of whatever method you choose, though expecting the user to carry this knowledge through a complex form can cause unnecessary [validation](?tab=validation) errors when required fields aren't labeled.

## Copying an input value

If a user needs to copy the value within an input, consider pairing it with a [CopyButton](/components/copy/button) with the input control. This can reduce the friction of manually copying a value to a single targeted action.

![CopyButton paired with an input control](/assets/components/copy/copy-button-composition-single-line-input-simple.png)

Visit the [CopyButton guidelines](/components/copy/button#composition-with-other-components) for more details on this specific composition.
