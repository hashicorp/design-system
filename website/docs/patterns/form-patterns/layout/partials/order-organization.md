Fields within a form generally fall into three need-based categories that can determine order and organization within a form: **technical and application needs**, **user needs**, and **business needs**. These categories don't exist in isolation but have a cumulative effect on how a user perceives a form and how likely they are to complete it.

## Need-based organization

### Technical and application needs

Sometimes the values or options for a given field depend on information or selection from a previous field.

Generally, fields that are dependencies for other fields benefit from being organized closer to the start of a form. For example, selecting a cluster tier reveals options for cluster sizes that are only available for the previously selected tier.

### User needs

Users benefit from logical organization and progressive organization, organizing fields from easiest to hardest.

This can help increase form completion by:

- giving the user a sense of accomplishment early on through “quick wins”
- reducing the probability of the user abandoning a form when they’ve already completed the “easier” segments.

### Business needs

Organizing fields based on their importance (high to low) to completing the form can help minimize abandonment, a crucial aspect of meeting business goals and metrics.

## Logical organization

Organize fields logically; consider how users fill in information based on the context.

For example, when filling out a payment form, organize the fields in the same order as they appear on a credit card or payment method: name, card number, expiration date, security code.

## Visual organization

Once a logical organization has been established,

- categorize elements and fields into sections,
- introduce typographic elements to establish hierarchy,
- and, if necessary, [use dividers](#using-dividers) to differentiate sections clearly.

Each one of these methods will help the user better parse and understand the relationships between each section and the fields contained within.
