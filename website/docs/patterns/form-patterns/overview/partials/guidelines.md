## Text

In sections consisting of multiple blocks of text, use an 8px vertical gap between elements.

Text elements within a form should use logical, step-based sizing to reinforce hierarchy within sections and the form itself. While specifics around type hierarchy should be determined at the application level, adhering to these guidelines will help establish consistency at the page level and when constrained within another element or component.

## Required and optional

For complex forms, indicate **required** fields. This is the most explicit and transparent method and ensures users don't have to make assumptions.

For shorter, simpler forms, indicate **optional** fields instead.

Don't mix required and optional labels, stick to one or the other. Using one method can imply that fields without a label are the inverse of whatever method you choose, though expecting the user to carry this knowledge through a complex form can cause unnecessary [validation](?tab=validation) errors when required fields aren't labeled.
