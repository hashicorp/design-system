**Intro: what is interaction within a multi-select pattern?**

## Consistent communication

- Always communicating the the users that they have some results selected, even if they are out of view.
- Putting safeguards in place to ensure that unintended changes or deletions don't happen with selected results that are out of view.

## Selection scope

- Selection in different areas of the UI communicates different scopes of selection.
    - Row-level scope
    - Page-level scope
    - Global scope
