![Multi-select anatomy](/assets/patterns/multi-select-patterns/selection-anatomy.png)

| Element | Usage | 
|---------|-------|
| Selected count | Required; displays the number of selected items in the table. |
| Selected message | Required; explicitly communicates that elements results the table have been selected. |
| Total results  | Optional, but recommended; Displays the total number of results in the data set. |
| Actions trigger | Required; use either a secondary Button for single actions, or a secondary Dropdown for multiple actions. |
| Bulk actions | Optional; consolidates multiple bulk actions into a single element. |
| Bulk selection | Optional; consolidates multiple selection functions into a single element. |

## Spacing

### Mutli-select pattern

Within the Multi-select pattern itself, use a 16px horizontal gap between the message and the actions.

### In context

Within a larger context, use the same spacing recommendation of 16px vertical gap between the pattern, filter elements, and data set.

## Basic layout

In a basic example of a Table, place the selection pattern above the top-right corner of the Table with a 16px gap in between.

### Layout with a filter pattern

When composing a Multi-select pattern with a [Filter bar](/patterns/filter-patterns?tab=specifications#filter-bar-1) and [Applied filters](/patterns/filter-patterns?tab=specifications#applied-filters-1), maintain the sample placement.
