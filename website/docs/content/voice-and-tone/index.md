“Voice and tone” is how we communicate with our users via copy. The “voice” is our personality and the “tone” is how we express that personality.

## Voice

The HashiCorp voice is smart, professional, technical, to the point/factual, clear, and helpful. We’re not overly know-it-alls, mean-spirited, or condescending. Our goal is to be educational and helpful.

## Tone

We’re guiding our customers on a transformational journey to the cloud. The goal with everything we do is to be an educational guide that illuminates the path to cloud success. Our message should be smart, helpful, and to the point to enable human conversations.

### Smart

We are professional and our human conversations are pragmatic and kind.

### Helpful

We are inclusive, educational, accessible, and knowledgeable.

### To the point

Our message is conversational, concise, and factual. Avoid overusing jargon.
