“Voice and tone” is how we communicate with our users via copy. The “voice” is our personality and the “tone” is how we express that personality.

## Voice

The HashiCorp voice is smart, professional, technical, to the point, factual, clear, and helpful. Our goal is to be educational and helpful and not portrayed as know-it-alls, mean-spirited, or condescending.

### Smart

We are professional and our conversations are pragmatic and kind.

### Helpful

We are inclusive, educational, accessible, and knowledgeable.

### To the point
