### 2.8.0

**August 21st**

- `Hds::Card` updated default value of @overflow argument to "visible" to address an area of consumer confusion and better support the most common use cases. 
[(#1492)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1492) Thanks [@KristinLBradley](https://github.com/KristinLBradley)! 
    - ‚õîÔ∏è `Breaking change` technically, this is a breaking change as it will require consumers relying upon the previous hidden default value to now manually set the value. The result of not setting the a hidden value can cause square edges of some images to "stick out" and overlap the rounded corners of the Card itself. We considered this to be a fairly minor, low-impact issue however which would not affect functionality or usability.

- `Hds::Form::TextInput` add loading state on "search" type. [(#1452)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1492) Thanks [@alex-ju](https://github.com/alex-ju)!

- `Hds::Accordion component` add component [(#1423)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1423) Thanks [@KristinBradley](https://github.com/KristinLBradley)!

- `Hds::PageHeader` set position to 'relative'. [(#1466)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1466) Thanks [@alex-ju](https://github.com/alex-ju)!

- `Hds::Textarea` fix border and text color for readonly state. [(#1470)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1470) Thanks [@alex-ju](https://github.com/alex-ju)!

- `Hds::Modal` prevent onClose callback function invocation when isDismissDisabled is true. [(#1456)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/145) Thanks [@alex-ju](https://github.com/alex-ju)!

- `font-weight` of the `button` mixin explicitly to `regualr` instead of relying on inheritance (components using this mixin: `Button`, `Dropdown::ToggleButton` and soon `Accordion`) - No visual difference expected. [(#1469)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1469) Thanks [@didoo](https://github.com/didoo)!

**August 21st**

- `Hds::Disclosure` refactored internal utility component into two new components. Renamed from `Hds::Disclosure component` to `Hds::MenuPrimitive`. `Hds::DisclosurePrimitive` component stripped of the 'click outside/unfocus/esc to close' functionality. [(#1371)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1371) Thanks [@KristinLBradley](https://github.com/KristinLBradley)!

- `aria-label` update to support for consistency. Consumers can now see in the component API docs where @ariaLabel is supported for a custom value, and what the fallback value is. [(#1373)](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/pull/1373) Thanks [@MelSumner](https://github.com/MelSumner)!
