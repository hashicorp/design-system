</p>


### August 2nd, 2024

`ApplicationState` - multiple enhancements to the `ApplicationState` including:

- Added support for a media slot, which when enabled, will be added above the title, allowing yielded illustrations to occupy that space.
- Added an `alignment` property which can be set at the root level to `left` or `center`. This adjusts the component’s text, footer actions, and media alignment.
- The footer now supports up to three actions at once, modeled after the Button Set. Previously the actions were justified (one all the way left and one all the way right). Supported actions now include Dropdown, Button, and Standalone Link. Previously Standalone Link was the only supported option.

Notable visual changes in the `ApplicationState`:

- The divider has been removed to modernize the component and align with our visual standards.
- The title text will be reduced from Display 400 to Display 300 to better fit within the page hierarchy.
- The icon and title have been changed from `foreground/faint` to `foreground/strong`. The body text has changed from `foreground/faint` to `foreground/primary`. These changes better align with our color standards established with other components.

`Enterprise Navigation` - multiple enhancements to navigation components including:

- Added a new `AppHeader` component to contain global and utility navigation elements.
- Added a new `AppSideNav` component which shares features and functionality with the legacy `SideNav`
  - The legacy `SideNav` is marked as **deprecated** and will be removed from the library once adoption of the `AppHeader` is complete.
- Add a new `Application Template` which provides a consistent starting point for the UI chrome with HDS navigation components (`AppHeader`, `AppSideNav`, and `AppFooter`).

### February 27th, 2024

#### Breaking changes

`Alert` and `Toast` - Updated the `StandaloneLink` to the secondary variant from the primary variant to align with our documented usage recommendations.

_Updating the `StandaloneLink` to the secondary variant will revert any changes you've made to the text and leading icon properties. Prior to updating the library we recommend annotating (with a comment or otherwise) work that is in progress or is still being referenced by engineering with the intended text and icon variant._

`Table` - multiple enhancements to the `Table` components including:

- Added support for multi-selection with `Header Column / Selection` and `Cell / Selection`.
- Added support for a `Tooltip` in the `Header Column` component.
- Updated the visual language of the sort button in `Header Column` by decoupling the sort functionality into a nested `Sort Button`

_Adding support for a `Tooltip` and updates to the `Sort Button` result in a breaking change in sortable variants. While the `Label` in the `Header Column` should persist, we recommend annotating (with a comment or otherwise) work that is in-progress or still being referenced by engineering with the columns that are intended to be sortable._
