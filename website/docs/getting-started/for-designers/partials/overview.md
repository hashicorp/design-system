## Figma libraries

The HashiCorp design system team publishes and maintains a set of core Figma libraries for use in any HashiCorp team within our Figma organization. These libraries are currently not available for public consumption outside of HashiCorp.

- [Product Components](https://www.figma.com/file/noyY6dUMDYjmySpHcMjhkN/HDS-Product---Components?t=Ooe3pkDap3cGcgAH-1): the primary set of components published in the HashiCorp Design System
- [Product Foundations](https://www.figma.com/file/oQsMzMMnynfPWpMEt91OpH/HDS-Product---Foundations?t=4kdgl88SMIiEYhbA-1): core styles including typography, color, and elevation that are consumed by HDS components and published for reuse in your products
- [Flight Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/TLnoT5AYQfy3tZ0H68BgOr/Flight-Icons?t=nEh4FAxdjRsVInyL-1): core icon set for reuse in your products

All of these libraries are published under the [HDS Design System UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1030156573400567478) team for use in HashiCorp product design. We do not currently support marketing design efforts directly, but occasionally plays a consulting role in component and pattern design.
