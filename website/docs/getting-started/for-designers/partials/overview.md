If you’re a designer new to the Helios Design System or are looking to get up to speed on the strategy, design language, and best practices used in our libraries, this getting started guide should be your first stop. We’ll walk through:

1. enabling relevant Figma libraries
2. how to use them in the context of a project
3. the design language at the core of the the system
4. and best practices when working in Figma and using the design system components and styles.

This guide contrasts [getting started for engineers](/getting-started/engineers), but understanding the core concepts of each will aid in communicating your designs and understanding the implementation methods in code.

## Figma libraries

We publish and maintain a set of core Figma libraries for use by any product team within HashiCorp. These libraries are only available for internal consumption.

- [Product Components](https://www.figma.com/file/noyY6dUMDYjmySpHcMjhkN/HDS-Product---Components?t=Ooe3pkDap3cGcgAH-1): the set of components published in the Helios Design System
- [Product Foundations](https://www.figma.com/file/oQsMzMMnynfPWpMEt91OpH/HDS-Product---Foundations?t=4kdgl88SMIiEYhbA-1): core styles including typography, color, and elevation that are consumed by Helios components for reuse in your projects
- [Icons](https://www.figma.com/file/TLnoT5AYQfy3tZ0H68BgOr/Flight-Icons?t=nEh4FAxdjRsVInyL-1): core icon set for reuse in your projects

All of these libraries are published under the [HDS Design System UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1030156573400567478) team for use in HashiCorp product design. We do not currently support marketing design efforts directly, but occasionally play a consulting role in component and pattern design.

## Recommended plugins

!!! Warning

**Warning**

As a general rule of thumb, we don’t recommend tying core design functionality to third-party plugins. These plugins are not supported directly by Figma and are subject to errors if Figma’s API or core functionality changes. Only use plugins as a support mechanism within your design files.

!!!

Plugins can be used to extend Figma’s native functionality and make life a little easier by simplifying repetitive tasks. Here is a small curation of the plugins that our team members like to use:

- [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736000994034548392): generate varying lengths of placeholder "lorem ipsum" content in a text layer.
- [Stark](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948): a toolkit for measuring accessibility criteria in your designs.
- [Super Tidy](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731260060173130163): bulk rename, reorder, and reorganize layers, frames, and other elements within Figma.
- [Flyover](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1008819354278038466): showcase your designs with smooth animations in a presentation-like format.

The [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community) contains many other useful resources for documenting your designs, wireframing, and collaborating with your team.
