Figma is an incredibly versatile tool, but this versatility can backfire, spawning disorganization, inconsistency, and difficulty in an engineering handoff. These best practices should help organize your designs and use the components and styles provided by the HashiCorp Design System effectively.

!!! Info

These best practices have been curated by the HashiCorp design system team, Figma has it's own set of [best practices](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/) for using the platform effectively.

## File hygiene

### Naming conventions

- How to name:
  - Projects
  - Pages
  - Layers
  - Components
  - Variants

## Component availability

- Decision tree for deciding when to use a component
  - When to use HDS
  - When to use Structure
  - When to build your own

## Component instances

## Local components

While the core component and foundation set published in the HashiCorp Design System covers most use cases for low-level atoms and molecules, combinations of components and [patterns](/patterns) are not currently supported. As a best practice use components and foundational styles when extending the system and creating local components and patterns.
