!!! Info

While the steps included in this documentation are specific to HashiCorp's Figma organization, [Figma's documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma) is equally useful when learning how to enable libraries and use them in your projects.

!!!

## Enabling libraries in your project

To start using HashiCorp Design System libraries in your Figma project, open the library selection dialog from the Figma icon menu in the top left.

The library selection screen lists all libraries available to you from within your Figma organization. Enable the HashiCorp Design System libraries by toggling them on.

Once a library is enabled there are multiple ways to use the components and styles in your project:

1. Assets panel
2. `Shift + i`
3. Copy and paste from the stickersheet

### Inserting components from the assets panel

Figma's [asset panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038663994-Name-and-organize-components#assetspanel) is an easy way to access all of the library components you have enabled in your project. Select the name or category of the component you would like to use or use the search bar at the top of the panel.

### Copy from the stickersheet

If you would rather visually select a component to use in your project, each component in the [Product Components](https://www.figma.com/file/noyY6dUMDYjmySpHcMjhkN/HDS-Product---Components?t=Ooe3pkDap3cGcgAH-1) has a stickersheet capturing the different variants and properties available in each component. Simply copy and past
