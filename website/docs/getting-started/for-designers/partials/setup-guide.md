!!! Info

While the steps included in this documentation are specific to HashiCorp’s Figma organization and libraries, [Figma’s documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma) is equally useful when learning how to enable libraries and use them in your projects.

!!!

## Enabling libraries in your project

To start using Helios libraries in your Figma project, open the library selection dialog from the Figma icon menu in the top left. This menu lists all available libraries within your Figma organization; enable relevant libraries by toggling them on.

![Opening the library selection menu](/assets/getting-started/designers/enable-libraries.png)

Once a library has been enabled in your project you’ll have access to it’s components from the [assets panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038663994-Name-and-organize-components#assetspanel) or via the [resources panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413-Swap-components-and-instances#quick-insert) with the hotkey `shift + i`.

Styles published by a library are available in the **layer styles panel** on the right side of the application window.

## Inserting components into your project

[Official Figma component documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)

### From the assets panel

Access library components via Figma’s [assets panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038663994-Name-and-organize-components#assetspanel). Select the name or expand the category of the component you would like to use and click or drag it into your project. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top of the panel, which returns results based on the component’s name, category, and description.

The shortcut `shift + i` opens the resources panel which exposes a list of recently used components, plugins, and widgets you have enabled in your project.

### Copy from the stickersheet

If you prefer to select a component visually, the [Product Components library](https://www.figma.com/file/noyY6dUMDYjmySpHcMjhkN/HDS-Product---Components?t=Ooe3pkDap3cGcgAH-1) has a stickersheet for each component displaying the different variants and properties available. Copying the component variant from the stickersheet and pasting into your project will maintain the link to the main component in the library, which means it will receive updates as they become available.

## Using library styles

[Official Figma style documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039238753-Styles-in-Figma)

Figma styles allow consistent application of color (as a fill or stroke), typography, and effects within your project, and are published in the [Product Foundations library](https://www.figma.com/file/oQsMzMMnynfPWpMEt91OpH/HDS-Product---Foundations?node-id=2916%3A4&t=5MKbTaM2QzE0F5KA-1). Styles can be added to a text layer, shape, or frame from the layer styles panel by hovering and clicking the four-dot icon next to each style property (either text, color, stroke, or effect).
