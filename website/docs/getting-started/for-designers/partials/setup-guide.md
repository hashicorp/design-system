!!! Info

While the steps included in this documentation are specific to HashiCorp's Figma organization, [Figma's documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma) is equally useful when learning how to enable libraries and use them in your projects.

!!!

## Enabling libraries in your project

To start using HashiCorp Design System libraries in your Figma project, open the library selection dialog from the Figma icon menu in the top left. This lists all libraries available to you from within your Figma organization. Enable the relevant HashiCorp Design System libraries by toggling them on.

Once a library has been enabled in your project you'll have access to it's components from the [assets panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038663994-Name-and-organize-components#assetspanel) or via the [resources panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413-Swap-components-and-instances#quick-insert) with the hotkey `shift + i`.

### Inserting components from the assets panel

[Official Figma component documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma)

Figma's [assets panel](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038663994-Name-and-organize-components#assetspanel) is an easy way to access all of the library components you have enabled in your project. Select the name or toggle the category of the component you would like to use and click or drag it into your project. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top of the panel which returns results based on the name and category of the component, as well as the description.

The hotkey `shift + i` opens the resources panel which exposes a list of recently used components as well as plugins and widgets you have enabled in your project.

### Copy from the stickersheet

If you would rather visually select a component to use in your project, each component in the [Product Components](https://www.figma.com/file/noyY6dUMDYjmySpHcMjhkN/HDS-Product---Components?t=Ooe3pkDap3cGcgAH-1) has a stickersheet capturing the different variants and properties available in each component. Simply copy the component variant from the stickersheet and paste it into your project. The component instance will remain linked to the master component in the library and receive updates as they are rolled out.

### Using library styles

[Official Figma style documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039238753-Styles-in-Figma)

Figma styles allow consistent application of color, typography, and effects within your project, are provided by the [Product Foundations library](https://www.figma.com/file/oQsMzMMnynfPWpMEt91OpH/HDS-Product---Foundations?node-id=2916%3A4&t=5MKbTaM2QzE0F5KA-1), and accessed via the right sidebar. Styles can be added to a text layer, shape, or frame by clicking the clicking the four dot icon while hovering on a style property (either text, color, stroke, or effect).
