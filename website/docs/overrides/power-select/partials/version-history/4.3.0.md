## 4.3.0

### Deprecated

In this version we have released the [SuperSelect](/components/form/super-select) component, as replacement for the `PowerSelect` Ember addon component. For this reason we now consider the PowerSelect style overrides as deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.

#### How to migrate

We now recommend migrating the existing PowerSelect instances to the SuperSelect component, which being built on top of PowerSelect, provides the same [Component API](/components/form/super-select?tab=code#component-api) but with much better accessibility.
