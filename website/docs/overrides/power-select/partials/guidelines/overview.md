[PowerSelect](https://ember-power-select.com/) is a popular Ember add-on aiming to overcome some limitations of the `<select>` tag. HashiCorp Design System only provides style overrides for this add-on to keep it in line with other form components.

Note: These style overrides assume the PowerSelect component is set up in your project using the default theme.
