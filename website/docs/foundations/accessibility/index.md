While our components are designed and developed with accessibility as a core requirement, they can still be implemented in a way that results in an application that is not conformant with WCAG Guidelines. To that end, we provide some considerations for application-level concerns.

## Accessible Routing

Adding support for accessible routing ensures that route transitions are appropriately announced to users with assistive technology. We recommend [ember-a11y-refocus](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-refocus), an addon that provides three things:

1. It adds a message to the page to let the screen reader user know that the route has changed and regular page navigation can resume (it is similar to [https://github.com/ember-a11y/a11y-announcer](https://github.com/ember-a11y/a11y-announcer) but does not use `aria-live`).
2. It moves the focus to that message for the screen reader user, effectively resetting focus in Ember apps (similar to how a native web page/site works).
3. It provides a bypass mechanism so the user can skip to the page’s primary content (see [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G1.html](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G1.html)). You can opt out of this if you want (see the `Options` section in the documentation for available options).

## Page Organization

All content should be contained in elements with [landmark roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles). Typically this will be the `header`, `main`, and `footer` elements, but depending on your page layout, you might also be using `aside` and `nav` as direct descendants of the `body` element as well.

## Titles and Labels

### Page titles

Ensure that each page has a relevant page title. This is included in Ember applications by default, but older applications that have been updated over the years may need to manually add this in with [ember-page-title](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title).

### Headings

Headings (h1-h6) should follow a logical order and not skip any levels. Dynamic applications can make this challenging, so this may require extra attention in checking what renders to the browser.

### Input labels

All inputs should have associated labels. These are built-in to the form components. If you need to compose custom fields using the base elements, remember that a `placeholder` attribute is not an acceptable substitute.

### Accessible name

Not every element is allowed to use `aria-label`. Check the [element’s role documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions) to see what aria-attributes are permissible. When in doubt, ask in [#team-design-system](https://hashicorp.slack.com/archives/C7KTUHNUS)! As the saying goes, "no ARIA is better than bad ARIA!"

## Focus Management

There are some key points to remember about focus management:

1. Focus should return from whence it came. If a button toggled a modal window, closing that modal window should return focus to the button.
2. Trap the focus! Focus should remain in a modal or other popup when it is open. Try [ember-focus-trap](https://github.com/josemarluedke/ember-focus-trap).
3. Focus order should match DOM order.

## Automated Testing

Use available automated tooling for static and dynamic analysis. Ember apps can use [ember-template-lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint) for static analysis and [ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing) for dynamic analysis. Additionally, consider adding HTML validation to your CI.

## Manual Testing

- *Keyboard support:* ensure that your application is keyboard navigable. Everything that you can do with a mouse should have an equivalent experience with a keyboard!
- *Browser extensions:* there are a few browser extensions that can help you with accessibility. Microsoft’s [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) and Deque’s [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) are two popular extensions that can help you check for accessibility issues right in your browser.
- *Safari and VoiceOver:* your development environment has a screen reader built in! Become familiar with VoiceOver use it to test your application with Safari, especially if you are creating a non-standard UI and want to make sure that it will be inclusive for our users.

## Accessibility Support

don’t forget that there are other ways to learn more about implementing accessible applications. Training is available for HashiCorp employees through our internal learning library; look for the Accessibility section!

There is also the Accessibility Guild where HashiCorp employees of all roles can join and learn more about accessibility topics. With multiple meeting days/times that accommodate a globally-distributed workforce, there is sure to be something for everyone. We also record meetings and make those available for those who are unable to attend.
