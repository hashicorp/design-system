Border tokens are coming soon! Once Figma adds support for `border-radius` as a style, they will be added.

## Border radius

We don't currently offer border radius tokens or Figma styles.

The size of the component determines the border radius. These are high-level guidelines for how border radius is used in our components.

| Size        | Value | Examples                       |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| Extra small | 3px   | Checkbox                       |
| Small       | 5px   | Badge, Button, Form Components |
| Medium      | 6px   | Card, RadioCard, Alert, Toast  |
| Large       | 8px   | Modal                          |
