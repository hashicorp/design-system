The suggested way to apply the typographic definitions to a UI element is using the **predefined CSS helper classes** provided.

#### Design tokens

There are numerous [typographic design tokens](./tokens) in our system.

Since they are "atomic" definitions that associate a particular typographic property (e.g. `font-size`, or `line-height`, or `letter-spacing`) to a single value, they are not exactly "typographic" styles.

For this reason we **strongly advise against** using them directly in your CSS, and prefer the CSS helpers provided by the system, to avoid "mix & match" of typographic styles.

#### CSS helper classes

There are different CSS helper classes that can be used for different purposes.

If you want to change **only** the _font-family_ you can use one the "font-family" helpers:

```handlebars
<p class="hds-font-family-sans-text">...</p>
```

These helpers are meant to use in very special cases, when the designers used custom typographic styles.

_Notice: the "font-family-sans-display" helper is intented for headings and titles, while the "font-family-sans-text" helper is intended for body copy text. The "font-family-mono-code" helper is intended for monospaced text._

In most of the cases, you will use the _typography_ CSS helpers:

```handlebars
<p class="hds-typography-display-300">...</p>
```

These classes will contain, in a single declaration, everything that you need to apply a "standard" style to an element: _font-family_, _font-size_, _line-height_, plus a reset for _margin_ and _padding_ to `0px` (to match how they behave in Figma).

If you want to change the _font-weight_ of an element you can use one the "font-weight" helpers:

```handlebars
<!-- with font-family CSS helpers -->
<p class="hds-font-family-sans-text hds-font-weight-medium">...</p>

<!-- with typographic style CSS helpers -->
<p class="hds-typography-display-300 hds-font-weight-semibold">...</p>
```

These are the **CSS helper classes** that you can use:

To use this classes you have to import the CSS file `[products|devdot]/css/helpers/typography.css` from the `@hashicorp/design-system-tokens` package.

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: ðŸš¨**

*   while the _font-family/font-weight/typography_ helpers can be combined together in code, in reality not all the combinations are valid from the design perspective: please refer to the design documentation to see which styles combinations are allowed.
