## Semantic styles
Helios publishes a set of **semantic** styles and tokens that are labeled with their intended usage. For example:

- `Surface / Primary` would be used as the main (or surface) background color of a component.
- `Foreground / Primary` would be used for primary text elements or elements that sit on top of a surface background.
- `Foreground / Action` would be used for an actionable or interactive element within a component or page (i.e. a [Link](/components/link/standalone))

At this time, color styles are the only category for which semantic tokens are available. Semantic styles and tokens have yet to be defined for typography and borders.

## Palette color styles

When choosing what color style to use in your design, we recommend starting with semantic styles as their usage is clearly defined and common color pairings are accessible out of the box. If you donâ€™t find a semantic style that meets your needs, a set of base `Palette` styles that are labeled with a numerical scale are also available. These styles are usage agnostic which can introduce challenges in consistently scaling a complex design, but allow more freedom and flexibility in color pairing.
