## How to use

There are two different ways to apply a color to a UI element, via **design tokens** or via **CSS helper classes**.

Which one to use depends on the context since both refer to the same design token values. From the design system perspective there’s no difference between the two methods (it’s more of a preference for the “consumer” codebase).


!!! Info

At the moment the CSS helpers are available only for “semantic” colors. In the future we may offer helpers for “palette” and “product/branding” colors, but for now for these colors you have to use the design tokens as CSS variables.

### Design tokens

You can use the color [design tokens](../foundations/tokens) directly in your CSS definitions:

```css
.your-selector {
  color: var(--token-color-foreground-primary);
  background: var(--token-color-surface-faint);
  border: (--token-color-border-strong);
  & :hover {
    color: var(--token-color-foreground-high-contrast);
    background: var(--token-color-foreground-action-active);
  }
}
```

### CSS helper classes

You can use one of the predefined “color” CSS helper classes:

```handlebars
<div class="hds-foreground-primary hds-surface-faint hds-border-strong">...</div>
```

To use this classes you have to import the CSS file `[products|devdot]/css/helpers/colors.css` from the `@hashicorp/design-system-tokens` package.

!!! Info

When a “border-color” CSS helper is used on an element a `1px solid` border is applied to it: if you need a different border `width/style` you have to override it.
