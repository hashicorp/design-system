We’re happy to provide support to HashiCorp product teams that use Helios. Use these resources to get help.

## Live support

Join the [#team-design-systems](https://hashicorp.slack.com/archives/C7KTUHNUS) Slack channel to ask questions, request and provide feedback, or start a conversation with our team. As a globally-distributed team, there may be a slight delay in answering some questions, but we’re committed to responding in a timely manner.

## File an issue

 * Find a bug? 
 * Want to report an accessibility or security issue? 
 * Looking for a new icon or component?  
 * Want to propose a new pattern?

[File an issue in our backlog](https://go.hashi.co/hds-support) and we'll get back to you ASAP.

Users external to HashiCorp can [file issues in GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/issues/new/choose).

## Office hours

Office hours are a great way to get feedback on your project or help to get unstuck in a code migration. [Sign up for an appointment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LdyQznltt4VCbGGGDuDkARRRKXI4laCHxHhY8dJy4wE/edit?usp=sharing) at the next office hours.
