We are happy to provide support to HashiCorp product teams that use our design system. Here are some of the ways to get help if you get stuck.

## Office Hours

We offer office hours as a way to get feedback on your designs, or help you get unstuck in a code migration.

[Add your agenda item](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9T_M7gSAQ7zTM9z0gR11kvqpiTnbByrTsqDk305s3SxblRw/viewform) to the next office hours session (internal employees only).

## Live Support

Join the [#team-design-systems](https://hashicorp.slack.com/archives/C7KTUHNUS) channel in our company Slack chat to ask your questions and get some answers. Since we are a globally-distributed team, there may be a slight delay in answering some questions, but we are usually pretty fast!

## File an Issue

Find a bug? Want to report a security issue? [File an issue in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/issues/new/choose).

## Request a Feature

Use the [request a feature](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpMXgrUTVT5fYriu4Pp48r4Nl_eCPluVnJLg0Yg3NXsRWvIA/viewform) form for all of your feature request needs (internal employees only).
