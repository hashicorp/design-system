## What is a design system?

A design system is a set of guidelines, standards, assets, and processes to help organizations rapidly design, build, and deploy products in a consistent manner.

Design systems are often equated with a UI kit or component library; in reality an effective design system spans the entire lifecycle of a product through ideation to iteration and everything in between.

## Architecture

While the scale of a design system largely depends on the needs of those consuming it, the fundamental structure and architecture remains largely the same across systems.

- **Visual Language**: colors, typography, icons, imagery, content strategy
- **Components**: component design, component development, tokens, development standards
- **Patterns**: repetitive combinations of components and foundational styles that yield more complex functions and features
- **Documentation**: education, issue tracking, contribution, content management, processes

In Helios we structure our components, icons, and design tokens in a [monorepo](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system) using yarn workspaces and publish a collection of libraries in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1030156573400567478) for designers.

## Why use the Helios Design System?

While increasing visual and functional consistency across products is the most visibly notable result of design system adoption, the intrinsic value a design system brings can result in complimentary benefits:

- Increased velocity in the design and development of new products and features
- Dismantling of silos between departments that adopt and use the system
- More time spent on solving complex problems, less time spent on duplicative work rebuilding small atoms and molecules
- Components, foundations, and usage guidelines published by the the Helios Design System meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA conformance out of the box in accordance with our [accessibility statement](/about/accessibility-statement).

## Our consumers

HashiCorp develops and maintains a number of different products with varying sub-brands and approaches to the user experience. In an effort to bring these different product lines and teams towards a common visual language and single source of truth, the Helios Design System was born.

Helios has been adopted at varying levels by all products within the R&D organization. We work closely with these teams at the integration and implementation level while collecting feedback to better understand consumer needs and inform our [roadmap](https://go.hashi.co/hds-rollout).

For more information on adoption, visit our getting started documentation (for [engineers](/getting-started/for-engineers) and [designers](/getting-started/for-designers)) or visit our public [GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system) repository.
