## 4.12.0

Fixed issue with `box-sizing` inheritance due to a `all: unset` CSS rule

## 4.10.0

Added the `@titleTag` argument to `DialogPrimitive::Header`

## 4.7.0

Added a set of utility "dialog" sub-components to act as primitives for `Modal` and `Flyout` (and to be used as standalone subcomponents if needed):

- `DialogPrimitive::Header`
- `DialogPrimitive::Description`
- `DialogPrimitive::Body`
- `DialogPrimitive::Footer`
