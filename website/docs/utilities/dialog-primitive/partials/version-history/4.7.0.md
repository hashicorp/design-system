## 4.7.0

### Added

Added a set of utility "dialog" sub-components to act as primitives for `Modal` and `Flyout` (and to be used as standalone subcomponents if needed):

- `DialogPrimitive::Wrapper`
- `DialogPrimitive::Header`
- `DialogPrimitive::Description`
- `DialogPrimitive::Body`
- `DialogPrimitive::Footer`
