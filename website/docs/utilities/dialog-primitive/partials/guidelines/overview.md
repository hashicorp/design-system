The DialogPrimitive contains the building blocks used to construct dialog-based components and consists of:

- `DialogPrimitive::Wrapper` is the structure that contains and arranges all other dialog primitives.
- `DialogPrimitive::Header` contains the title, dismiss button, and optionally a visually supportive icon and tagline.
- `DialogPrimitive::Description` contains optional descriptive information about the dialog.
- `DialogPrimitive::Body` is a generic container that houses the main content or message of the dialog.
- `DialogPrimitive::Footer` contains buttons to act on the content in the body container or link to additional resources.
