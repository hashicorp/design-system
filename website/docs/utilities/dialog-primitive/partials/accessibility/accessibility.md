When used as recommended, there should not be any WCAG conformance issues with this component.

## Focus and focus order

- When the dialog is open, focus moves to the first interactive element within the dialog and is trapped within the component.
- Since a dialog is a complex pattern that can contain any combination of nested components and content, nested elements must adhere to their individual accessibility criteria.

### Focus order within a simple dialog

In the case the dialog is triggered via a keyboard, the dismiss button must be first in the focus order since there isnâ€™t any content within the body that is eligible to receive focus.

### Focus order within a complex dialog

If the dialog body contains interactive content, such as input fields, the first element should receive focus first regardless of how the dialog is triggered; either via a mouse click or via the keyboard. This behaviour should be implemented by [setting the focus on the first element](/components/modal?tab=code#form-within-a-modal-dialog).
