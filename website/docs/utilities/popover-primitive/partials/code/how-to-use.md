## How to use this component

The `PopoverPrimitive` is a **headless component** that associates a "toggle" element with a "popover" element (both elements act as containers). "Soft" (hover/focus) or "click" event listeners can be assigned to the "toggle", and when triggered they toggle the visibility of the "popover".

When the "popover" is visible, it can be closed in various ways: toggling via the "soft" or "click" events, clicking outside of the popover, or via the `esc` key.

Under the hood the component uses the [native web Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) to promote the popover content to the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer). This solves the issues related to stacking contexts and provides the "light dismiss" (click outside / `esc` key) out of the box.

The primitive also uses the third-party library [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) to provide the anchoring and automatic positioning/collision detection functionality.

For older browsers (in particular Firefox 124 and older) that don't support the Popover API, it uses a [Popover Polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill) library to emulate the native behaviour.

The internal logic and APIs of this component are quite complex, it's impossible to describe everything in detail. Below we provide a few basic examples, but if you need more in-depth knowledge of how the primitive can be configured and used we suggest looking at the source code of the component itself, as well as the `hds-anchored-position` modifier, which is a custom wrapper around the Floating UI library.

### Basic invocation

The basic invocation of this primitive sees three different modifiers (`setupPrimitiveContainer`, `setupPrimitiveToggle`, and `setupPrimitivePopover`) applied to three distinct elements (they can be HTML elements or Ember components):

```handlebars{data-execute=false}
<Hds::PopoverPrimitive as |PP|>
  <div id="container" {{PP.setupPrimitiveContainer}}>
    <button id="toggle" {{PP.setupPrimitiveToggle}}>toggle</button>
    <div id="popover" {{PP.setupPrimitivePopover}}>popover content</div>
  </div>
</Hds::PopoverPrimitive>
```

The primitive itself doesn't provide any styling to the container, toggle, popover (and arrow) elements, and doesn't generate any extra HTML beyond the one yielded to the component itself. It provides only the popover, anchoring, and collision detection functionalities to the elements that the "setup" modifiers are applied to.

### Event listeners

The visibility of the popover can be toggled via "soft" event listeners (hover/focus) applied to the toggle element:

```handlebars{data-execute=false}
<Hds::PopoverPrimitive @enableSoftEvents={{true}} as |PP|>
  <div id="container" {{PP.setupPrimitiveContainer}}>
    <button id="toggle" {{PP.setupPrimitiveToggle}}>toggle</button>
    <div id="popover" {{PP.setupPrimitivePopover}}>popover content</div>
  </div>
</Hds::PopoverPrimitive>
```

_Notice: from a purely technical standpoint, the events are `mouseEnter/Leave` and `focusIn/Out`._

Alternatively, the toggle behaviour can be enabled via "click" events:

```handlebars{data-execute=false}
<Hds::PopoverPrimitive @enableClickEvents={{true}} as |PP|>
  <div id="container" {{PP.setupPrimitiveContainer}}>
    <button id="toggle" {{PP.setupPrimitiveToggle}}>toggle</button>
    <div id="popover" {{PP.setupPrimitivePopover}}>popover content</div>
  </div>
</Hds::PopoverPrimitive>
```

!!! Warning

Important: if you don't apply either `@enableSoftEvents` or `@enableClickEvents` the popover will not become visible with any kind of interaction (unless it's rendered already opened via the special `@isOpen` argument).

!!!

### Content positioning

The popover element can be positioned in relation to the toggle anchor using the `placement` argument of the `@anchoredPositionOptions`:

```handlebars{data-execute=false}
<Hds::PopoverPrimitive as |PP|>
  <div id="container" {{PP.setupPrimitiveContainer}}>
    <button id="toggle" {{PP.setupPrimitiveToggle}}>toggle</button>
    <div
      id="popover"
      {{PP.setupPrimitivePopover anchoredPositionOptions=(hash placement="top-start")}}
    >popover content</div>
  </div>
</Hds::PopoverPrimitive>
```

### Collision detection

The collision detection logic can be controlled using the `enableCollisionDetection` argument of the `@anchoredPositionOptions`:

```handlebars{data-execute=false}
<Hds::PopoverPrimitive as |PP|>
  <div id="container" {{PP.setupPrimitiveContainer}}>
    <button id="toggle" {{PP.setupPrimitiveToggle}}>toggle</button>
    <div
      id="popover"
      {{PP.setupPrimitivePopover anchoredPositionOptions=(hash enableCollisionDetection=true)}}
    >popover content</div>
  </div>
</Hds::PopoverPrimitive>
```

For details about how the collision detection works refer to the [Floating UI > Tutorial](https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial).

### With an arrow

It is possible to account for an arrow element in the positioning of the popover, if an `arrowSelector` (or directly an `arrowElement` reference) if provided to the `anchoredPositionOptions`:

```handlebars{data-execute=false}
<Hds::PopoverPrimitive as |PP|>
  <div id="container" {{PP.setupPrimitiveContainer}}>
    <button id="toggle" {{PP.setupPrimitiveToggle}}>toggle</button>
    <div
      id="popover"
      {{PP.setupPrimitivePopover anchoredPositionOptions=(hash arrowSelector="arrow")}}
    >
      <div id="arrow" />
      popover content
    </div>
  </div>
</Hds::PopoverPrimitive>
```

### Other `anchoredPositionOptions`

There are more possible options and configurations that can be provided to the popover via the `@anchoredPositionOptions` argument. Refer to the [Component API](#component-api) section below for more details, and to the code of the `hds-anchored-position` modifier for in depth understanding of how this modifier works under the hood.
