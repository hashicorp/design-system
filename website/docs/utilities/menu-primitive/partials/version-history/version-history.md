## 4.10.0

In this version we replaced all `MenuPrimitive` instances with `PopoverPrimitive`. For this reason we now consider the MenuPrimitive deprecated and we plan to removed in a future major release.

### How to migrate

Consider migrating the existing `MenuPrimitive` instances to [`PopoverPrimitive`](/utilities/popover-primitive).
