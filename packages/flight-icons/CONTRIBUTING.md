# Updating the icons in `flight-icons`

Whenever there is an update to the Flight Icons library in Figma (e.g. a new icon is added), these changes need to be transferred to code. This means updating the `flight-icons` package and then releasing it to the npm registry, which other tools and projects can use.

We have developed a set of custom Node.js scripts to create a single pipeline for this purpose. The pipeline can be run manually on your local machine or via a GitHub Action.

With either approach, it will be necessary to add a commit creating a changeset entry [via the instructions in our readme](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/blob/main/README.md#changesets).

## Automated process

Run the [Sync & Build Icons action](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/actions/workflows/open-pull-request-for-icon-update.yml) on the [Actions tab in GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/actions) to create a PR with the updated icons automatically.

## Manual process

### Before you run the scripts

* Make sure you have:
  * done the initial setup of the project (see details above)
  * added the Figma token to your environment (see details below)
* Make sure your local `main` branch is up to date
* Create a custom branch from `main`.

### Sync

The "sync" step exports the assets from Figma and saves them in the project.
You can find the code that relates to this step in the file `/scripts/sync.ts`.

To run this script launch the following commands in your CLI (while in the `flight-icons` folder):

```bash
yarn sync
```

This action will:

* Retrieve the assets metadata from Figma via REST API
* Export the assets as `.svg` files into `./svg-original/`
* Generate the `catalog.json` file

*ðŸš¨ **Notice**: it's not uncommon that when doing a `sync` you will find that some SVGs of the icons appear as "modified" in the codebase even if they have not been really changed by the designers. The reasons can be different: Figma has slightly changed the algorithm that generates the SVGs in output, or the designer changed the order of the icons in the frame, or maybe just Figma changing by a sub-pixel the internal path of an SVG element. In these cases it's hard to detect if this change is OK or not. You have to try to understand if it's expected or not, and if you want to be 100% sure you have to compare the SVGs (old and new) importing them in Figma and overlaying one on top of the other and eyeball if there are differences.*

### Build

The "build" step takes the assets exported from Figma, optimize and process them, and saves the final SVG files in the bundles that will be published as npm package.
You can find the code that relates to this step in the file `/scripts/build.ts`.

To run this script use the following command in your CLI (while in the `flight-icons` folder):

```bash
yarn build
```

This action will:

* Optimize the SVG files and save then in a `temp` folder
* Process the optimized SVG files and save then in the `svg` folder as standalone SVG files
* Process the optimized SVG files and save then in the `svg-sprite` folder as SVG sprite within a JavaScript module

### After you have run the scripts

* Check the git diff:
  * if you see only the `lastRunTimeISO` value changed in the `catalog.json` file it means there are no updated to the icons, so there's no need to commit the changes.
  * if there were changes to the icons, you will see changes to the `catalog.json` file and to the content of the `svg` and `svg-sprite` folders.
* Commit and push the changes, then submit a pull request in GitHub.
* Once approved and merged to the `main` branch, you can proceed to the release phase.

### Releasing a new npm version of the package

Follow the instructions for Changesets in the root [README](../../README.md).

#### Figma Token

To access the Figma file via REST API is necessary to have [a special authentication token](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens). This token is personal, should not be shared or committed to the repo.

To create your personal access token, open Figma and go into *Account > Personal access tokens* and create one for yourself.

Next, add a `.env` file in the `packages/flight/flight-icons` directory, to which you will add the variable:

`FIGMA_TOKEN=###`

where `###` is your personal access token. You can use the `.env.template` file you find in the repository as model, if you want.

**IMPORTANT**: the `.env` file is ignored by git, and should not be committed to the repository.

Once you've done the initial setup, there are distinct steps in the process to follow to update the icons.
