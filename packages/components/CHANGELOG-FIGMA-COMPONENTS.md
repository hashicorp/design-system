### Figma v2.0 Components

- Deprecated HDS Components UI Kit v1.0. It will no longer receive updates or support.
- Released HDS components UI Kit v2.0.

In many cases, replacing v1.0 library components with the components in the Figma v2.0 Library will result in breaking changes. For a comprehensive list of how these changes will impact your designs, refer to the [changelog document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9IGtrsVOf3KrSBGb8AdF3OhPUm3fYAwPdhSml7onMM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.15f60fqiivvr).

#### General changes

- Improved consistency in component naming conventions
- Enhanced property panel customization options
- Reduced variant complexity through boolean properties
- Added local tokens for custom styling (hidden from publishing)
- Standardized nested component structure

#### Component organization updates

- Standardized naming conventions, nested structures, and boolean property usage to reduce complexity.
- Updated organization with "Form /" prefixes and DialogPrimitive as the base for modal components.
- Introduced [Template] components for common combinations.
- Improved nested component accessibility for easier customization.

## August 2nd, 2024

`AppHeader` - Added a new navigation component to contain global and utility navigation elements.

`AppSideNav` - Added a new component that shares features and functionality with the legacy `SideNav`.

`Application Template` - Added a template component that provides a consistent starting point for the UI chrome.

`SideNav` - **Deprecated** the legacy navigation component. It will be removed from the library once adoption of the `AppHeader` and `AppSideNav` is complete.

### Breaking changes

`ApplicationState` - multiple enhancements including:

- Added support for a media slot above the title.
- Added an `alignment` property which can be set at the root level to `left` or `center`.
- The footer now supports up to three actions at once. The actions are now organized in accordance with our [Button Organization](/patterns/button-organization) pattern.
- Updated several visual styles including:
  - Removing the divider
  - Reducing the title from `Display/400/Bold` to `Display/300/Bold`
  - Changing the icon and the title color from `Foreground/Faint` to `Foreground/Strong`
  - Changing the body text color from `Foreground/Faint` to `Foreground/Primary`

_Adding support for three actions within the `ApplicationState` results in a breaking change to the previous actions. Before updating the library, we recommend annotating the text and icon name (with a comment or otherwise) in files that are in progress or still being referenced by engineering._

## February 27th, 2024

### Breaking changes

`Alert` and `Toast` - Updated the `StandaloneLink` to the secondary variant from the primary variant to align with our documented usage recommendations.

_Updating the `StandaloneLink` to the secondary variant will revert any changes you've made to the text and leading icon properties. Prior to updating the library we recommend annotating (with a comment or otherwise) work that is in progress or is still being referenced by engineering with the intended text and icon variant._

`Table` - multiple enhancements to the `Table` components including:

- Added support for multi-selection with `Header Column / Selection` and `Cell / Selection`.
- Added support for a `Tooltip` in the `Header Column` component.
- Updated the visual language of the sort button in `Header Column` by decoupling the sort functionality into a nested `Sort Button`

_Adding support for a `Tooltip` and updates to the `Sort Button` result in a breaking change in sortable variants. While the `Label` in the `Header Column` should persist, we recommend annotating (with a comment or otherwise) work that is in-progress or still being referenced by engineering with the columns that are intended to be sortable._
