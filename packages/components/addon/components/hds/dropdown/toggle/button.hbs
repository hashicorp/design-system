//
// Notice: in this component we're directly using the `Hds::Button` component
// (and adding a specialized class for the "toggle-button" variant, see below)
// If you need to change the styling of the `Button` component, remember that this will impact also
// this component too.
// If instead you need to change only the styling of the `toggle-button` component, you can do it
// in the CSS file using the specialized class declared there.
// This is NOT a standard approach that we use in the HDS design system implementation, but it's been
// the least worst option we could find to solve the problem of sharing the exact same style of the
// `Button (primary)` with other components.
