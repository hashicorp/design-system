<section aria-labelledby="ds-purpose">
  <h3 class="dummy-h3" id="ds-purpose">Purpose</h3>
  <p class="dummy-paragraph">The purpose of the design system is to provide a single source of truth for the design
    vision needed to build accessible, differentiated experiences for HashiCorp's products.</p>
  <p class="dummy-paragraph">The Design System Team designs, creates and supports the design system, with input from our
    partners in product design and the engineers that we support.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ds-purpose">
  <h3 class="dummy-h3" id="ds-usage">Usage</h3>
  <p class="dummy-paragraph">While the technical usage instructions are available in the
    <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system/blob/main/README.md">design-system repository</a>, this section
    intends to clarify the (other/philosophical/strategic) usage details.</p>
  <p class="dummy-paragraph">First, it should be make explicitly clear that the design system does not intend to be a
    1:1 replacement for existing styles, components, or code that may exist, not only because it seeks to unify design,
    provide accessibility conformance and code consistency, but also because previous implementations across products
    have proven to be inconsistent in all of these areas.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ds-features">
  <h3 class="dummy-h3" id="ds-features">Documentation Features</h3>
  <p class="dummy-paragraph">The documentation for each component contains a few distinct features:</p>
  <ul class="dummy-list">
    <li>Component definition: the first few sentences on the component page provide the definition of the component in a
      glossary-type way. This is important because there is no standard dictionary of UI components and a single
      component could be called many different things. By including this definition, we intend to reduce the number of
      assumptions about what we intend for the component to be.</li>
    <li>API documentation: this documents the component's API, its intended type, acceptable values, and any defaults.
      Note: We recognize that
      <span class="dummy-code">enum</span>
      does not exist in JavaScript (natively), but it best describes the intention of the property defined.
    </li>
    <li>Usage Instructions: The "how to use" section includes copyable code and in some cases outlines the different
      types of usage examples for that component. While these instructions may not include everything you can do with
      the component, they show the intended use of the component.</li>
    <li>Design Guidelines: these are currently in an image form and should also have a link to the relevant (internal)
      Figma file.</li>
    <li>Accessibility: This section outlines the purpose of the component, lists any known accessibility issues, and
      links to the relevant WCAG success criteria for that component.</li>
    <li>Showcase: This section is mostly for the use of our visual regression testing tool, Percy.</li>
  </ul>
