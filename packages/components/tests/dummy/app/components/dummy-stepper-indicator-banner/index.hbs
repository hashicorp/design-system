    <h3>Stepper Indicator components and a11y concerns</h3>
    <p>At this time the HashiCorp Design System only publishes and supports a Stepper sub-component labelled as an <code>Indicator</code> which acts as a visual decorator when assembled into larger <code>Step</code> and <code>Task</code> patterns.</p>
